We (as global citizens) experience new ideas and changes that are very similar to what the Europeans saw during the Scientific Revolution, the only thing is that we are more educated, enlightened, maybe jaded to just step back and be totally awestruck at every one.
But just like the Europeans during that time frame, there are a lot of leaders who look at gains in science (stem-cell research in particular) and scream heretic.
Whoever coined the phrase â€œhistory repeats itselfâ€ was dead on; the world we stand on today very much parallels the world (from the timeframe) that we just studied.
We have â€œleadersâ€ who feel that they have been chosen (or rather appointed) by God, put holds and criminal penalties on scientific research that would blow the doors wide open on disease, censor artists, control the flow of every piece of information we receive by allowing the media conglomerates to consolidate and become fewer and fewer and further the fight for â€œglobalizationâ€ with this plan for New World Order, but the â€œleadersâ€ get to pick and choose who gets to play, just like they do with the joke they call â€œfair tradeâ€.
Many of these thingsâ€¦fear of science & technology, the (attempted) Christianization of the world, meaningless wars for personal gain, greed, an attempt at extremely cheap global labor, to the point of slavery, no interest in human rights or the public interest, these are all ideas that are spoon fed to us (with a little sugar to make it go down easier) as the way the country/world needs to go.
The United States alone is a prime example; we are in the fast lane towards becoming what is basically a two class society.
They have led us to believe that as long as you have a job you are middle class, notice that there are no more poor people in Americaâ€¦politicians no longer speak of the poor, the media certainly doesnâ€™tâ€¦and weâ€™ve been led to believe that all of the people who sleep on the streets at night, do it by choice because they are lazy.
They told all of us to go to college and get trained for new careers because the manufacturing jobs were going, and they werenâ€™t coming back (to steal from Bruce Springsteen), that is why institutions like this were created.
Now those jobs are gone, they say donâ€™t worry youâ€™ll get trained for new jobs, bigger and better jobs, but theyâ€™re going to rapidly close institutions like this, and make education privilege, all the while taking the jobs and outsourcing them to India and Pakistan where they can basically pay them no more than $2 a day, and have what basically amounts to â€œlegalized slaveryâ€.
Is it any coincidence that the only jobs we can get are at the friendly, neighborhood Wal-Mart, at the same time that they (Wal-Mart) are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to privatize education.
Once they take away education, the powers that be are able to keep the population down, and they can hypnotize and woo us with religion, as long as we pray to the right god and wear the right medallions.
These ideas are changing the world, and not for the better, we are basically sitting back, and allowing â€œhistory to repeat itselfâ€ when in fact, we can step up and stop it.
I know that this maybe upsetting and possibly offensive to some, and I may just have totally jumped on a soapbox and moved off of the topic, but I firmly believe that the state of the world today emulates the state of the world at that very time, and at the rate these ideas and tactics are moving there is the grave possibility that things will get darker before we see any improvement; unless we stand up and fight.
These things are all going to lead to one thingâ€¦an uprising, maybe not a full-blown revolution, but something will more or less take place to take something back from the ruling clas.
atherhood, impending like a storm, not a violent turbulent storm; the type of storm that blows roofs off houses and turns trailer parks around.
This is the kind of storm that you look forward to after a hot, humid East Coast day.
The kind of storm that cools everything down just before the ice cream man comes with his evening sing song.
As frightening as it is, I long for fatherhood to comeâ€¦to feel his feather-soft skin against my naked chestâ€¦to smell the sweet scent of innocence and youth wafting from his head.
How I long for my youth, to be virile and fearless leading young Jack through adventure after adventure.
But alas, my youth is goneâ€¦replaced by sensibility (I laugh at the very thought) and a fear factor that longs to tumble down an incline at forty miles-per-hour, but simply knows better.
How I long to spend every possible waking hour with him; showing him the things that I had to learn on my own.
I want to give him all of the tradition, but remain unorthodoxâ€¦refusing to surrender my identity.
He will help me, more than I will ever help himâ€¦centering me, balancing me, ensuring that Iâ€™m half of the man that Iâ€™ve always wanted to be.
I love him alreadyâ€¦shit, I love him more than anything that I have ever knownâ€¦it brings tears to my eyes, and yet all that Iâ€™ve seen of him is a horribly blurry pictureâ€¦black and white nonetheless.
It puzzles meâ€¦how can I love something so much, but never to have seen it?
Itâ€™s unexplainable like the passing of the seasons or the mysteries of God!
All I know is that I need to prepare for his arrival; and I donâ€™t know how.
The things I need to accomplish are things that I have dawdled over for ten years or moreâ€¦and now I have five monthsâ€¦lord knows it is such a tumultuous time to bring a child into the world, but I will protect him from everything against the grain, everything evil.
I would go against everything that I believe in to ensure his sanctity.
I guess society would say that Iâ€™ve forsaken his future for my own happiness.
This may or may not be true, and I probably wonâ€™t ever have the ability to shower him in luxury, but hopefully throughout everything I will have maintained my integrity.
This I can pass onto him; a gift far greater then cars, gold, or an Ivy League education.
I pray (to whoever will have me) that I lay the foundation for him to do something, anything to shake up the system.
Like the San Francisco writers of a generation past, I hope he makes the status quo stop and say â€œWhoaâ€â€¦but I would never pressure him to do anything, to be something.
He only needs to be a manâ€¦a good man, a man with integrity and kindness in his heart for the world, and then I can restâ€¦be able to close my eyes and drift away with the pictures, memories of our life together clutched in my hand, and his undying love beating through my heartâ€¦I love this baby to be called Jack, more than he will ever know.
