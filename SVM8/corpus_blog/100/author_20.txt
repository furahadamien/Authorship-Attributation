One thing that's not too painful to do is to ge the weather forecast.
It only takes like four or five button presses.
But what I don't understand is if its called the  seven day  forecast, why does it only show me five days?A great list of parts that people need (mostly racing & bikes), that someone could make some money fabricating:hollow boltsfront forksbolt sleaves (1/2")The trick would be making up the tooling so each of these could be produced with a minimum of labor and wear on the cutting edges.
