If you want to knit one, too, here's the made-up-as-I-went pattern:  On size 5 US double pointed knitting needles, cast on 48 stitches, join, and divide among 3 needles.
Actually, the execution wasn't that hard, but it doesn't look that great.
So, the new issue of  urlLink Knitty .
Unfortunately, I'm really sick of my hoodie.
That's the next thing on the needles, and I will work on my hoodie here & there, too.
Cleo is slowly killing me.
I guess I will just tough it our and work on the hoodie.
I'm so pleased she decided to order this yarn.
The last row should be the bottom of your cozy.
I am considering making  urlLink hush hush .
I am going to finish off a Big Bad Baby Blanket for my friend,  urlLink langus , who has thrown in the towel.
The yarn arrived for my sister's  urlLink Cleo  halter.
Anyway, overall, I'm pleased with the top.
I think some of the stuff is cute, though I am more inclined to make things I can show off, I guess because I'm still newish and it feels like such a giant accomplishment every time I finish a piece.
I just want to be done with it already.
I need to go back and add the hood to my hoodie.
People seems to feel strongly.
I had to learn kitchener stitch, which sounded easier than it was.
I can't start Viv's cardigan, since I'm waiting for the yarn to arrive.
It's really a cool pattern, once you sit down and do it with out small-child interruptions!
