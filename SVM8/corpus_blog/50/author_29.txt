No, my tummy ain't exactly a carbon copy of J-Lo's, I'm still not sure why I got it *Haha* But it looks good and I found out I'm down  3  sizes!
Not exactly mine, but the first I drove after I got my liscense; a red suzuki swift  20.
I tagged along but Shakhira was to send me back to my car later.
Shakhira didn't want to, besides Diana told us that they're gonna bring in a table from outside and put it at our usual corner.
Went to dinner with Diana, Ninie and Shakhira at Modesto's.
It's definitely time to give up.
It stinks of stale smoke.
Right now, I'm gonna quit whining and do something.
I'm kinda bored and getting lazy to write more.
It's back to my salads n bread n nothing else!!!
My birthday's gonna suck mass0r ass.
Next thing i know, he was waking me up asking for my room key.
Me and Diana got to  urlLink American Chilli's  on time, but Shakhira ran a little bit late because she fell asleep.
Today (14th): Got up at 1pm, had one hell of a fucked up lunch (can't even remember what), munched on tiny cookies, went to 1Utama with Fahmy, watched him eat wishing I could too, Shakhira joined us, followed her around shopping and last minute v-day gift hunting, Fahmy dropped me off, munched on tiny cookies, had dinner alone, munched on tiny cookies, got emotional, danced to a few cool tracks alone, all the while feeling super fucked and now feelin majorly fat and depressed.
Yes, to teasings n laughter.
I feel like hanging out, but don't know where and all that.
I do realise this, but, like I said, I'm spinning out of control and  I don't know how to stop.
Nothing that comes to mind at the moment.
Diana went home, but we stayed until after 3am.
Got myself some new clothes, lippies and shoes.
