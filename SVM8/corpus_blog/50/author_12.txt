and he says something something that is so unbeliveably true that it just blows my mind.
I feel bad though because brandon got one before for doing the same thing, i kind of want some punishment because what i did was wrong and i dont deserve to get off free.
Most of all I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Why hello America and or whoever reads this, how are we.
At courtney's last night we watched monster, a really gay movie which depressed the hell out of me and we made cookies and cupcakes and i whipped up a couple of my world famous grilled cheese's for a few of the people there i have to say they were a few of my best ones yet.
So today i pissed my pants with fear.
2 weeks ago i was driving home from going to the YMCA as i was sitting on first ave in traffic  i look in my rear view mirror and to my delight, in the car behind me........a rather large girl was not only singing, but yes, dancing to her radio.
Secondly, Courtney I'm sorry, for everything.
at this time i was informed of how they were seeing evan at his work so i drove on over there and become informed by evan about how i just missed them.
I need help, i think i spend to much time thinking up excuses for my problems with diseases.
So i guess thats all for today and im gonna go play some fight night 2004 before i have to take it back tonight later ya'll If you comment in my blog, don't be gay, leave a name.
thats just what i needed to get off my chest.
dont like our leaders, dont vote for them.
Thirdly, everyone else who resents me for my actions this weekend, I'm sorry, for everything.
I hate that game and i refuse to play.
Good movie even better time.
Not wear makeup in public?
nothing i can do about it though.
Evan- I'll have some iced tea Me- which one of your lemonades to you recommend?
If you know who you are, im me and tell me what you think.
