Smeagle:"Woman is not evil.
Seriously, how many times has a person done good but recieved bad in return.
dun think she would appreciate anyone using her back as an eating table...........  anywayz, to end it all...........i think it's really nice of the tv station to start advertising the new t-shirt bra on my birthday..........but..........im not really interested in the bras..........could they show something else?
and why a girl's body?!?!
or maybe wear something else........or something less?
why izit that bad things start with "s"?
cos of balance...........when we grow old, we cant be shagging like rabbits like we do now when we are young....our bodies jus cant take it.........tho the government would love it..........but most importantly, i think our libidos die off mainly due to the "ick" factor...........no one would EVER want to know that their grandpas and grandmas are still going abt it like rabbits in the middle of the nite...................yea.......there are many going ons far scarier than the things u imagine go bump in the middle of the nite.............  but then of course, we humans, we like to screw around with things (yes, pun intended)...........we came up wif viagra, wif cialis, wif miracle drugs dat give men longer lasting boners even when we suffer from muscle atrophy or erectile dysfunction..............oh yea...........ED will no longer exist...........it'll be like smallpox.............eradicated...........cos there'll be traces of miracle drug passed on to future generations due to viagra induced pregnancies...........  bcos of our screwing around............both ways meant..............there comes the imbalance..............ever heard of the number one oxy-moron (an oxy moron is a combination of 2 words wif clashing meanings) "civil war"?
the whole file-sharing thing basically jus involves the student and the recording authorities...........so what has the school got to do with it?
oh no, it looks like it's gonna rain, did i leave the windows open at home?
I don't getit............why bog students down with stupid things such as "all numbers can be written as primes or have a prime factor in them"..............i mean, a number is a number!!!
She is just a very deluded and insecure girl who needs to surround herself with alot of guys to assure herself that she is attractive and have power over men."
then there was another incident..........this happened abt 2 nites ago..........happened to my fren actually......... my fren had stopped in a carpark to drop off 2 others..........and after the 2 fellas got off the car, guess what happened.........a female driver decided to try and matchmake her little hyundai accent with my fren's car door........ she was reversing out of the parking lot and banged into my fren's passenger door........... it's ridiculous~!
it is to bring an end to the suffering of others in this episode................  yea, and so he can jus blow off the whole thing and enjoy his money without any more scrutiny on his future lifestyle..........and the pple who believe he's doing good.....................time to wake up and smell the roses lah................dumbasses............. alrite............i need cash.........i need lotsa cash...........i need tons of cash..............y?
for me it used to be fear of skinny women with big heads cos their bodies looked like they would fall apart if you touched their heads..........and now with the bottom heavy women.........you might just need a big roll of black tape by your bedside in case her waist breaks off..............black tape works wonders.........for that matter, the girl can go..........men can jus shag the roll of black tape.............. many times i have found out that it's extremely difficult to resist temptation.............like for example last time i spent a huge bomb on my car's head unit and front speakers...........knowing very well that in the future i would be spending more on changing ALL the speakers in the car..........and today..........or the past few days rather..........the itch to change ALL my speakers came.............and boy it itches real bad...........  anywayz..........was thinking abt some of the crazy things ive done in the past while i was washing the car.........and i think it would suffice to say that ive committed my fair share of blunders in my 23yrs of life.............  23yrs..........sometimes it doesnt really hit me..............jus the other day my fren was telling me that another fren was going into NS soon..............it went something like this:  Fren : "hey, you know xxx is going to NS soon."
exams in 1 week's time and i cant concentrate~!!!!
actually there is nothin humanly possible.............first of all wat's the prob?
I mean think about it...............air is colourless.............but we cant see air............you cant say black or white or grey.........cos those are colours too in a way..........they reflect certain lightwaves and absorb some to produce the colour........so if the world were colourless, what would we see?
That's just another part of my plan for world domination.................*evil laff* (In case you haven't noticed, you already forgot the last few sentences and dismissed them entirely.
first of all, the blardy ass part.............after being sentenced, he said his conscience was clear...........yea rite.........u r a friggin religious leader.............dun say this sorta bullshit for pple to hear lah..............ought to be shot.............stinking son of a bitch..............many pple say wat he did is btwn god and himself...........yea...........if that's the case, god probably asked him to take the money..........and when asked how god communicated with him........he would say he heard voices........better yet, he sees dead pple..........then i would wonder who he worships actually...........  next is the smart ass part.............yea, joachim kang is one smart ass.............think there would be some who would agree with me that by confessing, he would end all the hoo ha and jus serve a short sentence before coming out to live life as a rich elderly man...........yea, he'll probably leave some money to be recovered by the authorities, but he would most probably have some stashed elsewhere.............i mean, look at it.........serve 7.5yrs.........then come out with maybe half of the money still stashed.............and a man who has the capability of embezzling such an amount most probably would have anticipated such a scenario...............  when he said the pple must understand the reasons behind why i am confessing.
So for those who are still in lala land, pls go smack yourself in the face.
