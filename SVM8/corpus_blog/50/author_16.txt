so if anybody out there has $2600 extra dollars you're just willing to give away, let me know.
We may go eat thai food tonight, and I would enjoy that.
In other news, both Brett and I got mopeds in the past few months!
And if we ride to the far right (in theory to allow cars to pass easier) we're actually putting ourselves in far greater danger than if we ride in the middle of the lane.
I really should clean the kitchen, hem my pants, do laundry, etc...but I just don't want to.
I feel like an introduction is in order, so here's a bit about me.
I'm still in my pajamas and it's 12:17 p. m.  I haven't done this in ages.
I'm so glad I have the day off today.
So Brett and Wendy and Caleb and Marci and I were riding around Baxter Boulevard when a cop pulled up behind us, flashed his lights, and pulled us over.
Well, as of Saturday, we are connected to the rest of the world, thankfully!
That's my psychological epiphany for the day.
I'm here at work, and it's Saturday.
right now, it's dictated by school work friends boyfriend homework....all of which are good, but there are a few of those i wish i could get rid of altogether (homework, work)...but i can't.
It is pretty slow, however, hovering at about 29 on a good day with no wind.
it's such a great church.
Can I just say that I hate work right now?
I guess I can muster up the energy to at least do a load of laundry and wash some dishes.
She's one of the only people (women) that I feel remotely close to here.
I hate, hate HATE automated telephone systems.
So that pretty much means I should get going...I'll try to write more soon!
