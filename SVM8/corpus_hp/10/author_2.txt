Snape paused for breath, glaring menacingly.
He suggested before his friends could start bickering.
Harry thanked the twins again, before wandering over to the other side of the common room, where Hermione and Ron were immersed in conversation, their faces grim.
If Minerva was surprised by his sudden question, she didn't show it.
Weak, tired and a bit dizzy.
'Come on Ron, breakfast will be over soon!'
Snape was snarling by the end of diatribe.
He waited for Snape to start yelling at him, to list off each and everyone one of Harry's flaws and threatened him with expulsion.

Snape clamped his hand onto Harry's shoulder, and steered him into his office without another word.
Hermione's birthday was only three days away.

She paused for a moment, and then continued on in a softer voice, 'I know you dislike for him to be treated as anything but a normal child but in this instant, there is simply no other option.'
'I'm afraid you won't be able to play Quidditch for a few weeks, not until your injuries had fully healed and you've put on enough weight that we can be sure there's no risk for you of collapsing in the air'.
He needed to play Quidditch.
Snape's severe expression relaxed just a fraction.
'Please, Severus', Albus begged, turning the full force of his twinkling blue eyes on him, 'All I'm asking is for you to manage to the Hospital Wing for the next three days.
The jinx they'd used was a complex one, modified from its original version so that that every time the counter charm was cast, it promptly began to rain somewhere else in room.
'All those times I've treated him for Quidditch injuries and I never noticed anything amiss.'
Harry flinched slightly at the question and bit down hard on the inside of his cheek.
