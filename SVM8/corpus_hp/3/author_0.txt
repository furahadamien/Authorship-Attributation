"My apologies, Hermione."
Taking a deep breath to steady herself emotionally and she looked up at him.
"You should try sitting up here without as much as a ticking clock or the mutter of house elf," he countered.
He really didn't care one iota, but it was interesting none the less and broke up some of the otherwise monotonous days that blurred into one another, day after day, minute after minute and hour after hour all blurred into the murky mess of time that ticked by.
"Killing people is illegal as well."
Harry and Ron probably won't be back for days, or weeks so you are safe."
Legs swung over the edge of the bed.
He realised he had spent the entire night asleep and never once stirred and by the looks of it, either did she.
Why should she lie and walk around on eggshells just to appease the amazing Harry Potter?
She threw up another brick wall and with all her might pushed him from her mind in a panic.
She huffed, a pout creeping onto her lips.
It's admirable that you are looking out or me but I am fine.
It was a shame it was actually a crime to force students to consume the potions they fucked up.
He hated Harry and he hated him even more for using a spell he knew was not only dangerous but had the possibility to kill.
I'm sorry but due to the circumstances, I am unable to provide one," He snarled out, harshly.
A/N: Let me know what you all think?
He wanted to pluck it from her hand, hold it against her temple and unleash the killing curse on her and run.
Lips curling back into a sneer.
He held his hands up defensively at the sudden attack on him.
He may be bored but he wasn't going to beg for the displeasure of her company.
