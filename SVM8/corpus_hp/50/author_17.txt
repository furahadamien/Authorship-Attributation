Sirius hid a grin behind his play cards.
Teddy called from the playroom.
"Why didn't I think of that?"
"Ew, you are sweaty," they heard her say.
We have him this weekend remember?"
He looked up and she was smiling gently at him.
She squeezed her earrings in her hand.
"So, do you think either of them will ask her out?"
Her eyes brightened at the sight of Hermione.
I guess I just needed a good cry."
He scrunched his nose at the sight and sound.
"It's no problem, Tonks."
Carlie was pretty and funny, but he didn't want to bring her home to Sirius, Remus, and Tonks.
He honestly didn't know why he was still here.
Hermione squeezed his hand and sat down in her seat, sighing.
She hadn't spoken her thoughts aloud yet and she didn't know how to express what she was feeling or thinking.
He flipped through them and showed her the kitchen card.
He kissed her forehead and gently nudged her to the door.
She scooped some food into her mouth and contemplated over her own relationship.
Zenovia, showed her the easier locations to enter the magical community, the magical counterpart to the archaeological museum and much to Harry's chagrin, her own brother, who led Hermione through Delphi, Knossos, and the beach.
