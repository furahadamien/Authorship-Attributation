Honey, I would have brought you your breakfast!
She had the sudden urge to disapperate, but she knew that if she did, Parvati wouldn't leave her alone in the next few days and she would never reach her learning goal.
Ron finished his task and Hermione's blouse was dry and clean again.
Now I understand why she looked so confused when she said goodbye.
Ron heart seemed to sink into his feet.
Harry : Are you sure you're alright?
I'm going back to Parvati, take care… Ron: Take care yourself, Hermione.
He turned around to her again.
Hermione: Don't be scared!
He looked at the young witch again and noticed that her shirt was also wet and that her skin shimmered through the fabric.
Ron was used to Luna's open, direct manner and knew there was nothing to hide from her.
"Oh Hermione, get yourself together!
Parvati grabbed Hermione's hand and they both used the floo network to get to the Leaky Cauldron… -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- Ron stood in the orchard, hands shoved deep into his pockets.
"Hermione, pull yourself together!
Hermione watched him and then saw Luna put an arm around him.
I like to tease you a little.
Hermione was just leaving when Ron called her name.
When he pointed his wand at Hermione's blouse, she bit her lower lip and tried to control her thoughts.
Her face was surrounded by beautiful brown curls and her slender figure moved like in slow motion.
Plus, he's redheaded, and the last time I saw him, he was pretty damn hot!
