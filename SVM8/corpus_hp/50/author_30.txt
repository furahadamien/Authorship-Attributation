"Oh no Sir," Snape said with a light poke to the boy's back.
Sirius raised an eyebrow at this confession.
Snape hadn't asked about his behavior and Remus hadn't offered any information.
"Though the three of us got into plenty of trouble together."
Snape's grip on the teen's chin tightened slightly.
He reached out a hand running it down Harry's cheek.
"I don't want him to think that I snitched on him the moment he walked away."
Harry knew that he was playing with fire but he did not care.
Remus questioned in a friendly tone.
"This is not about being outside of the tent, not entirely that is."
"I think it will be brilliant," Hermione answered.
I promise you we got into plenty of trouble for our stunts."
Snape felt his insides coil slightly at the boy's words.
Harry smiled shaking his head.
Remus forced himself to refrain from telling the man how insistent Harry had been that none of this was his fault.
Harry questioned fighting to keep his voice serious and not to burst into laughter.
Especially when it came to Harry's safety.
"I plan on seeing that he takes a Dreamless Sleep tonight, just as you just did.
"Clearly I have been far too lenient with him in the past."
He wanted that Snape more than anything at the moment and he knew what he had to do to get him.
