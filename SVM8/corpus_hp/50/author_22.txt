This is how you change the channels," Tonks explained handing Sirius the television remote.
Remus offered her his arm, "I'll walk you to the stairs."
Or day's rather, I suppose…" she was rambling but he could be so damn quite sometimes it was near unnerving.
She smiled and gave him a wink, tapping her plate with her wand again.
"I can be rougher than Remus," he continued.
She started toward the hall.
She suddenly had second thoughts about smuggling them ingredients.
Honestly I don't know what you've been doing the past thirteen years without me."
Tonks stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, watching the two men, unsure of what to do, her wand still raised up high.
"Don't you want to go on this journey of nostalgic bliss with me?"
He felt a shiver run up his spine and an uncomfortable stiffness in his groin.
"Well I am not holding up my end of the bribe then," she insisted with her arms crossed.
She pulled back from his face, just a few inches, hovering her mouth in front of his, looking for a sign of approval.
Arthur gave him a huge smile and shook Remus' hand enthusiastically.
Tonks spent the night huddled on the floor with Buckbeak in the master bedroom.
Tonks slowed down, glad for a breather.
Might be nice not having to wait around for the newspaper…" "Sure.
"That's a little much Moony," Sirius chimed in, gazing at Tonks face.
This was a side of Remus she had yet to experience.
He waved his finger to emphasize his point.
