I am hoping time will help clarify some of these misexpectations.
You break me down in away very few have been able to break through or have tried.
It slows my desire to do much of anything.
I don't know any two women (outside of my mom) who love me more.
Tell you how I feel when ever your around.
Running in to these two wasn't in my plans but it sure made my day!&nbsp; urlLink urlLink    Bob and Robbie aren't they cute!&nbsp; urlLink The storm clouds rolled in yesterday They were there in the blink of an eye At first I thought them exciting, something new, a break from the light But as they steam rolled through the sky Their dinge flattening the color of the world The volcano of darkness began to well up in side me I poured water on my fears hoping to cool them And four a while the darkness lay dormant Till the clouds began to roar with pride The deep rumblings broke the crust and allowed the lava to flow through me I began to burn from the inside out.
The terror of a small town... only a couple of more years though.

I am not sure, I am not sure what I want and I am not sure what to do.
I risked it once before and was rejected, lost everything including part of my ability to trust and rely on people.
You always know just what to say you always know what I need.
Quite simple I am not sure if the risk is worth losing.
What your smile does to me or when I see you standing in a door.
I sit and ponder and think about all that goes on and all who interact with me.

I am becoming a giddy little girl everytime I see that he has wanted to interact with me.
I also am a little afraid about becomeing obsessive.
As long as everyone stays open and honest to it.
I mean I know there are people who love and care for me but I have gone so far away from all of them I am not sure what to do.
This light that shone through me whether I was going to follow it's agenda or not.
