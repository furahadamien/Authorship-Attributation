"I yelled after him, but he did not listen.
"Jeff whispered, smiling.
Suddenly, another blinding light made me look away.
* These questions raced through my mind.
""Oh yeah, Jefe said something really weird and -" A loud screech and thud interrupted my sentence.
"And where is the boy, Jefe?
"Wait a second, how did you know I come from Portugal?
"Are you feeling alright?
*What did Jefe mean by thousands of years?Why did this Jeep explode?Where did Jeff go?
I had counted to 69 Mississippi's in my head when Jefe - that was his name, according to the name tag I noticed and read after Mississippi 42 - suddenly jumped over the register onto the customer side.
It was on his lower left abdomen area, and it read Jeff.

My eyes scanned the parking lot and I gasped, quite audibly, when I saw what the Jeep had hit.
""*Eey*!You speak fantastic Portuguese, my friend!
Jefe burst through the glass door and out into the street, seemingly unaffected by the flurry of broken glass and metal that his body had encountered.
"He turned and walked back towards the kitchen, but stopped abruptly in front of the doorway.
*   The cashier had tears in his eyes and was staring right into mine with such intensity I had to keep blinking."L.
Before I could react, he started running for the door.
I stood by the window dazed as Jeff ran out of the store screaming.
