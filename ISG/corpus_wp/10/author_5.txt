"he said as shards of glass fell on his lap.
"He's dying!He's not gonna attack us.
He'd sent the same message to all his contacts and other random numbers.
""Took them all up in a big beam of light right in the woods.
Any feedback or criticism will be appreciated.
I reached out from under the sheets and looked at the notification.
He grabbed Mark and pulled him down and kicked out with his leg, kicking the umbrella away.
Mark charged on the passenger side and tried to force himself into the car.
In front of us, an old man lay on the road, he was bleeding, but still breathing.
I stepped towards the window to take a look when someone pulled me back by the shoulder.
Nothing I need to lose sleep about, I got college tomorrow anyway.
Jason was nowhere to be found.
Why'd he text me when he could've just woken me up?I clicked on the message.>Come outside!The moon is so beautiful tonight!I looked at the other messages, they were similar.
I scrolled until I came across a familiar contact.>JASON L.       My roommate, the stupid one.
""The one from the government or someone?""Yeah.
The crowd continued chasing us and getting smaller in the mirror until they stopped and turned back.
I reached out to my phone and turned the screen on again.
I swerved the car and punched him in the face.
I looked at the lock screen.>78 New Messages   The phone buzzed again.>79 New Messages   >83 New Messages   I swiped the screen and scrolled through the messages.
The lamp was knocked on the floor.
He pushed the stick through the gap in the curtains and moved it around, pointing the stick up and down and across.
"The man looked at me "The moon took them away" he whispered."What?
The engine roared to life.
We stepped outside and opened our umbrellas.
I put my foot down on the accelerator and drove as fast as I could.
"Mark said, putting his umbrella down.
He was screaming and growling.
Another group across the street in front of us, I swerved to avoid them when a rock crashes through the window and hit Mark."Shit!
""Gone too?What are you talking about?
"I pushed down on the accelerator and we drove out the garage.
As I got up I heard Mark scream.
We walked to the window and he started a video recording.
I looked at his sent messages.
"What happens if you look at the moon?
I didn't know any of these numbers.
My music system began blaring.
It's been a week since it happened.
They were standing on the street looking into houses.
This was getting annoying.
He put his phone in, but kept the back camera on.
It was a loud screech of at least fifty people screaming.
Who needs a warning at 3 AM to not look at the moon on a new moon night?Astronomers and space geeks probably.
Looking up the street I didn't see anyone coming.
He bent down to pick him up when the man's eyes opened.
He rolled over with Mark on the ground.
I filled my car and drove back home.-- This is my first writing prompt response.
There were books, and papers lying everywhere.
I picked it up and scrolled through his messages.
You can't be too careful.
I got in the car and shut the door as the man charged on my side, banging on the window as I turned on the ignition.
"Look " said Mark, starting the video.
It was unlike anything I could've imagined, the moon was huge.
There were also many messages similar to mine telling him to look outside.
I climbed in the driver's seat.
I guess"     "Is that what happened to Jason?""Yes.
The man joined him, and they both charged towards me.
What's with this moon thing tonight?I got up and walked to his room.
Nodding, I turned us towards the national highway, speeding faster.
The man kicked out and tripped me.
You don't want to accidentally look up and see the moon, do you?
"Mark said, as he got in the car.
""You become one of them.
Then we heard something else.
It was a text message.>OFFICIAL WARNING: Do not look at the moon.
"This is me, the same me I've always been.
I looked to him and saw him, staring at the moon, his iris turning from brown to pale gray.
We stopped and walked out under Mark's Umbrella.
In the rear view mirror I saw a massive crowd of people running towards us from behind our house.
It's like some kind of mind control.
It's probably a prank or something.
"She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Did someone break in?Did Jason fight him?It certainly looked like a fight had happened.
I looked up and saw my other roommate, Mark.
I wanna know what the whole moon thing is about.
I pushed down on the accelerator, speeding up when a someone jumped in front of our car and we crashed into him.
He was holding an umbrella and his face was covered in sweat.
"They're dragging people out to see the moon" Mark said.
He'd received the same warning as me, only a bit later.
A broken mirror lay on the floor.
My hands starting to shake, I turned the ignition on.
I put my phone back and closed my eyes.
I dozed off...  **3:13 AM**      *bzzz*     *bzzz*     *bzzbzzbzzzZZZ*      I woke up with a start.
He lost his grip and fell off as I drove off.
"I went to my room and grabbed my umbrella and put on a hoodie.
The windows were open and white moonlight was spilling through the gap in the curtains onto his floor.
The town was empty save for a few people.
Mark was waiting near the door.
I fell down on the floor.
"I said, turning the volume all the way down.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL       "What the hell?
I backed towards the car.
**3:00 AM**  *bzzz*  I groaned awake as my vibrating phone buzzed on the bedside table.
Someone screamed in the distance.
Everyone who'd looked at it".I couldn't say a word.
There were a few cars on the road.
What the actual fuck is going on, Mark?
"What if he's one of them?
"Did it happen here too?The moon?
"Away from here" Mark said.
"Isn't she beautiful tonight!?
