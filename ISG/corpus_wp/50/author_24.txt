Prepare to glass  the entire planet.
"I was answered by another swat on my tuchus.
Birds were chirping kids were playing in the streets, there wasn't a cloud in sight.
"She nodded vigorously, "That's Mr. Roboto, by Styx.
She faded away shortly afterwards.
"He pointed down a long and darkened hallway, "Walk straight down that hall until you see the three-headed dog, take the first left and proceed through the fires of everlasting woe, and straight through the P. E.T.
A massive spherical shape blocked out the sun for most of the central United States.
"People of Earth, may we have your attention please.
It firmly embedded itself in the wall behind me.
A.meeting-"  The damned soul interjected, "Wait, P. E.T.
"I placed my head in my lap, clutching my head.
Tomorrow was the day that the elves would load him onto the sleigh and force him to deliver their twisted gifts to all the boys and girls of the world.
Something incredible happened, I felt my missing fist smash into the face of the incorporeal entity.
Time was different on the sleigh.
He envied people blessed enough to burn in the fires of Hell.
They chittered and barked in a harsh broken tongue.
We can take the second option.
I felt her teeth come loose, pain explode in my 'hand' and a ghostly tooth lodge into my fist.
In a bit of a daze, I pushed open the gate and walked along the cobbled road leading to 'The River Styx'.At least that seemed to be consistent with what I had learned.
One answer I'd always wanted to give but never had the courage to, was that it felt mostly like hopelessness.
I looked at Sharon, staring death at her, "Why the shuck are we going in circles?
I'm not sure exactly where the spirits go after I beat them to a pulp, but I have purpose again.
They give me the fucking creeps.
It would last him a lifetime.
"Remind me to never get on the bad side of those retail workers.
It felt like I did anyway.
The Prefect barely needed a recording device to hear their response.
Besides, the pay for someone capable of genuinely dispatching a ghost is fantastic.
"the red-skinned Devil whirled his trident and cackled madly.
She never bothered me again.
It's difficult to describe exactly how it feels to have an itch on an arm that isn't there.
The Prefect sounded agitated, "Okay, okay.
She looked slightly mollified, "Now go clean your room mister.
Why was hell censored?I've been able to think and say it the entire time....Ah, because before I was just using it as a place, not a swear.
If you liked this, you'll love anything the man has to offer.
Check it out here: ########## I felt at my chest, feeling the ceremonial knife slipping between my ribs, piercing my heart.
Using the mirror as a reference, I leaped on the ghastly girl and smashed my non-existent fist into her face until she stopped squirming.
Inside one of the cabins sat an old man bent over a workbench.
A woman in a paisley dress walked out to greet me, her hair in curlers and a shoe held threateningly in her right hand.
"She giggled, "You're not paddling silly!I would have told you, but you seemed to be enjoying the chance to talk!
I was killed in a stampede of shoppers.
"_______________________________ /r/SirLemoncakes ########## It was a beautiful summer afternoon.
To my chagrin, I walked up to the titular river.
"His voice was being broadcast through every working system with a speaker, this did nothing but exacerbate his terribly grating voice.
"Thoughts of fire and brimstone warmed my mind as I slipped away into death...I blinked open my eyes, I was standing somewhere pleasantly warm and smelled slightly of fireworks.
As I stood to exit the boat, Sharon waved and said, "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto," in perfect time with the song.
I'm going to make you head of the torture division there.
Anyway, once you get down the last flight of stairs, you'll be in the department of bad managers.
"I winced at the censored word.
We were making large, lazy circles in the river, going nowhere.
She replied in a cheerful high pitched voice, "Nope, that would be my brother.
But every day which flew from the calendar, inching him closer to the hated holiday  was like a nail being driven into his skull.
""Wait, what level of Heck is this?
Before I knew exactly what I was doing, I lashed out with my missing arm.
She laughed again, I swore to kill the witch if she laughed....What did I just think?I would stab the punt....Shuck?Pass?Swat?I pulled at my hair, now firmly in the grips of an existential crisis.
He toiled away, stitching the leather of a harness.
""Son of a witch," I tried to swear.
"The Devil took a step back, "Ah," he replied, as if it all made sense now.
"She giggled that infuriating giggle again, I longed to strangle her, but I couldn't seem to move my arm to actually do the deed.
On the river sat a slightly bobbing paddle boat with a young woman at the main seat.
Most agreed that this was a sign of the apocalypse.
Scientists didn't know what to make of it, the military wanted to nuke it, and several of the world's major religions decided that it was a sign from God.
"As he walked off, the Devil shivered.
"I am here in order to deliver two options.
I am here to inform you that you are all in violation of several intergalactic treaties regarding population growth.
Honestly, I think people mostly pay for the spectacle of a one armed man fighting an invisible ghost.
"Let me get this straight, I can't even *think* bad words here?
I nearly screamed in impotent fury.
Losing the arm was essentially me losing my life.
"Of course not silly!This is Heck!You should have gone to Hell if you wanted to swear.
'I frowned, if I was where I thought I was, something didn't add up.
I walked along the friendly looking path, following signs for 'Circle of the Danged'.I came to the gateway which seemed to be made from old minivan parts and suit ties.
I could no longer play my favorite pieces.
I was so taken by shock that for a long moment I failed to really absorb my surroundings.
His torture was more refined and cruel than ever they could imagine.
Do I get a pitchfork or what?
"The damned soul smiled broadly, "I'll get right to work, Sir.
The parts of the year where the twisted elves only beat and starved him.
""Sir, I worked retail for *fifteen* fucking years.
He longed for the burden of Atlas or Prometheus.
Seriously though, when do I start?
We named the river after them, the boss is a big fan.
This was the perfect opportunity.
My electric toothbrush launched towards my head and I was narrowly able to dodge out of the way.
A.is actually evil, not just incompetent?
Essentially it's for folks who didn't quite rate Hell, and didn't manage to squeeze into purgatory.
Lights began to flicker in the room and objects around my sink began to hover menacingly.
A warm sensation spread from my wound throughout my body.
"People everywhere decided that this was the time.
He was expansive, well over six feet tall, with a bone-white beard which reached the middle of his broad chest.
", a droning voice said, "This is Bellagor, Prime Prefect of this Sector.
I learned that you can scratch your missing limb by using a mirror.
Remarkably, this works to eliminate the itch.
"Don't you try and use that kind of language around me young man!I'll paddle your behind!
They would finally get those televisions and digital watches they had always very much wanted, but could never afford.
Everyone always asks me what it feels like to no longer have it.
This is Heck after all silly.
I tried to flip her off, but managed only to give her a friendly wave.

"The Devil handed his pitchfork out for the soul to take, "Shit man, you can start right away.
