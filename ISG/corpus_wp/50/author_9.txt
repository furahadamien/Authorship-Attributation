She told everyone that a guardian angel stood over her, and that it told her not to give up.
It kind of bothers me how the number is off by one.
Not physically, but mentally.
Just letting the rays of the sun envelop me...It feels so pleasant.
*****  Four hundred and twenty three.
*****  Another child has been born.
If I don't reap them, their soul suffers and becomes damaged.
Their heart was open and it showered me in hope and gratitude.
I've... begun communicating with people.
I didn't know I could, but...  People can sense me.
*****  Nine hundred left today.
******  Dawn's mother woke up again today.
*****  Four hundred and twenty.
How could I even feel what death is like myself?The despair?The sorrow?Only in this situation could I feel things like that.
I've never taken pity before like this.
I don't want this Earth to die.
It's funny how the things that are most important to you only reveal themselves at times like these.
*****  Two thousand are left.
Don't you know that dying could be the end of everything right now?Are you so despondent you don't even care?
I want to see marvels of architecture, fresh after construction.
A malnourished couple both died when they tried to cross a river.
I want to see the rise of civilisations....I don't understand what's happened to me.
It's not a thing I normally do.
Death is definitely a type of fate.
After I fulfil my duties, the only thing that remains for me to do is to reap myself.
She should have died, but...I delayed reaping her for just long enough...  Just long enough for someone to find her.
She said I comforted her, and that she could feel that I was brimming with sadness and hope.
I'm exerting every bit of strength that I have.
What will happen to me then?I'll take time to consider this.
But now, every time I reap someone, it's like I'm dying myself.
I want to see cities brimming with life.
It's hanging on to her body by a thread.
A band of travellers have met up with Dawn and her parents.
It was so impersonal at first.
I've always been Death because the world needed Death.
I wish I could do it forever, now that I might not have forever to do it any longer.
They didn't think of me as "Death" today, but as "Fate".
*****  The number is going up.
I'm trying my best here...  Come on.
I'm telling her not to let this be the end.
They couldn't see me, but they talked straight at me.
*****  Four hundred and eighty three.
I don't plan on letting her inherit a dying planet.
I'm doing similar things elsewhere.
She can't abandon the last ray of hope on this world.
I push them away from danger, and towards supplies and shelter.
******  It's Dawn's first birthday today.
The world, it's dying, and I-  Even if I don't reap people, I can't stop them from dying if they just give up.
*****  Four hundred and fifty nine.
One by one, until no one is left.
*****  Two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine are left.
If I stay around... How will I cope with the emptiness?
I took pity on a young girl a few days ago.
They don't always listen, but it's a start.
But even so, I hope that one day they'll meet.
*****  Dawn's mother is sick.
*****  Eight hundred left.
Ercan and Dawn live half a continent apart, and they won't even grow up speaking the same language.
*****  Five hundred people left.
And yet, of all entities, me, the one who has had the most time to make sense of it all...I want things to continue.
It's my speciality, I suppose.
Twenty years ago she'd have survived with ease.
*****  Four hundred people left exactly.
******  I basked in the sun today.
*****  One thousand left.
She is a very sweet child.
If I fail, she might be the last human alive.
******  I'm caressing the soul of Dawn's mother.
He'd lost his entire family.
I cut the soul of the five thousand and first not one hour ago.
*****  I wonder what it means to be Fate, rather than Death.
She's dazed, but she spoke.
I've never realised how much it touches me deep down.
*****  Four hundred and eighty four.
Five thousand left today on all the Earth.
*****  Six hundred people left.
I've lived for such a long time that there are no words to describe it...Lived isn't really the right word.
The child carries my hope for the future with it.
This job is monotonous...But every day, I get a glimpse at what makes people truly human.
Understanding what this feels like firsthand is quite something.
*****  Four thousand are left.
I'm not the only one feeling it.
The four thousand and first committed suicide.
Basking in the radiating life force of this human being that's the beginning of it all is so much more fulfilling.
Someone...Someone talked to me today.
It's not a role I've played before.
But in the grand scheme of things, isn't fate more than that?
It's like it's telling me: there's one you're not counting.
I don't want things to end.
I'm forsaking my duties, but deep down I'm wondering if that's so bad.
Why did I keep being Death for such a long time after the world no longer needed me?The world needs Life right now, and I'm it.
I'm so worried about her.
*****  Seven hundred people left.
I don't stand in the sunlight so much any more.
I won't let her die of pharyngitis.
I won't let it be different now.
One by one, they'll fall.
The outcome seems inevitable.
*****  Dawn's mother, she...  She's going to survive.
Just like her namesake, she's crawling over the horizon, a shining beacon of a new future.
