"Look " said Mark, starting the video.
"I pushed down on the accelerator and we drove out the garage.
I pushed down on the accelerator, speeding up when a someone jumped in front of our car and we crashed into him.
You can't be too careful.
"I said, turning the volume all the way down.
Why'd he text me when he could've just woken me up?I clicked on the message.>Come outside!The moon is so beautiful tonight!I looked at the other messages, they were similar.
My hands starting to shake, I turned the ignition on.
The man kicked out and tripped me.
Everyone who'd looked at it".I couldn't say a word.
He'd sent the same message to all his contacts and other random numbers.
I reached out from under the sheets and looked at the notification.
I stepped towards the window to take a look when someone pulled me back by the shoulder.
In front of us, an old man lay on the road, he was bleeding, but still breathing.
Looking up the street I didn't see anyone coming.
I wanna know what the whole moon thing is about.
As the camera moved below, there was a group of about thirty people in the distance.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL       "What the hell?
""You become one of them.
It's been a week since it happened.
Then we heard something else.
Someone screamed in the distance.
A broken mirror lay on the floor.
It was a loud screech of at least fifty people screaming.
He'd received the same warning as me, only a bit later.
There were also many messages similar to mine telling him to look outside.
"Mark said, as he got in the car.
In the rear view mirror I saw a massive crowd of people running towards us from behind our house.
The crowd continued chasing us and getting smaller in the mirror until they stopped and turned back.
It's like some kind of mind control.
Who needs a warning at 3 AM to not look at the moon on a new moon night?Astronomers and space geeks probably.
What's with this moon thing tonight?I got up and walked to his room.
They were standing on the street looking into houses.
What the actual fuck is going on, Mark?
I reached out to my phone and turned the screen on again.
"he said as shards of glass fell on his lap.
"Away from here" Mark said.
I got in the car and shut the door as the man charged on my side, banging on the window as I turned on the ignition.
I looked at his sent messages.
I backed towards the car.
""Took them all up in a big beam of light right in the woods.
Nothing I need to lose sleep about, I got college tomorrow anyway.
There were a few cars on the road.
This was getting annoying.
I picked it up and scrolled through his messages.
""The one from the government or someone?""Yeah.
"Mark, wake up!This is not you" I said, standing near the door.
"Isn't she beautiful tonight!?
**3:00 AM**  *bzzz*  I groaned awake as my vibrating phone buzzed on the bedside table.
We stepped outside and opened our umbrellas.
"He's dying!He's not gonna attack us.
Jason was nowhere to be found.
Any feedback or criticism will be appreciated.
"I went to my room and grabbed my umbrella and put on a hoodie.
It's probably a prank or something.
The man joined him, and they both charged towards me.
We walked to the window and he started a video recording.
We stopped and walked out under Mark's Umbrella.
I dozed off...  **3:13 AM**      *bzzz*     *bzzz*     *bzzbzzbzzzZZZ*      I woke up with a start.
You don't want to accidentally look up and see the moon, do you?
There were books, and papers lying everywhere.
My music system began blaring.
Won't you look at the moon tonight?It's the most beautiful thing *ever*" Mark said, almost growling the last word.
"What if he's one of them?
"What happens if you look at the moon?
The lamp was knocked on the floor.
He rolled over with Mark on the ground.
The windows were open and white moonlight was spilling through the gap in the curtains onto his floor.
"Did it happen here too?The moon?
I scrolled until I came across a familiar contact.>JASON L.       My roommate, the stupid one.
The engine roared to life.
Mark charged on the passenger side and tried to force himself into the car.
"This is me, the same me I've always been.
I swerved the car and punched him in the face.
It was a text message.>OFFICIAL WARNING: Do not look at the moon.
I looked up and saw my other roommate, Mark.
The next morning I ran low on fuel in a nearby town.
He bent down to pick him up when the man's eyes opened.
Nodding, I turned us towards the national highway, speeding faster.
Another group across the street in front of us, I swerved to avoid them when a rock crashes through the window and hit Mark."Shit!
The town was empty save for a few people.
""Didn't you get the warnings?
He pushed the stick through the gap in the curtains and moved it around, pointing the stick up and down and across.
I guess"     "Is that what happened to Jason?""Yes.
I didn't know any of these numbers.
He was holding an umbrella and his face was covered in sweat.
It was unlike anything I could've imagined, the moon was huge.
He lost his grip and fell off as I drove off.
I looked to him and saw him, staring at the moon, his iris turning from brown to pale gray.
"She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Did someone break in?Did Jason fight him?It certainly looked like a fight had happened.
I looked at the lock screen.>78 New Messages   The phone buzzed again.>79 New Messages   >83 New Messages   I swiped the screen and scrolled through the messages.
I climbed in the driver's seat.
He grabbed Mark and pulled him down and kicked out with his leg, kicking the umbrella away.
Mark was waiting near the door.
I fell down on the floor.
I filled my car and drove back home.-- This is my first writing prompt response.
"Mark said, putting his umbrella down.
As walked in, my foot pushed something.
I put my phone back and closed my eyes.
I put my foot down on the accelerator and drove as fast as I could.
