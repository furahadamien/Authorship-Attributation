Or he would he would play connect-the-dots to make a picture of a lower number.
Then as luck would have it, the prison security system died, and we were all set free.
Head all the way to your right, I told the technician.
But how else could a person with 100 freckles be so unlucky as to be in this cell?I asked my cellmate this question, and he just laughed.
Apparently Hemiunu realized the universe wouldnt be ready for quite some time, and also knew that a multi-millennial game of telephone might result in the secret becoming distorted.
I had been invited to come to Egypt to decode strange writing found in a newly discovered chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
I was developing a sneaking suspicion the chamber was somehow connected to this young man, whose eyes were still locked upon the pyramid.
)Obviously I will appeal the ruling, but it will take time.
But stealing luck isn't even a real thing!It's like alchemy.
He tore his eyes from the pyramid and turned to face me as crumpled into the chair across from mine.
For just a moment, my father became lucid again.
The young man apologized profusely.
It had better work this time, Loonquawl, said another equally squeaky voice.
"I assured the young man as he hurriedly mopped up the spill.
I was somewhat worried that he would honor this sacred ground with an offering of vomit.
While they fought for their lives, those of us inside CFS were completely safeguarded from the virus and the after-effects.
Eventually every person outside the prison had died from the virus or from unsuccessfully fighting off carriers of the disease.
Hundreds of the world's luckiest people were all trapped in the unluckiest of places, in an impenetrable steel and concrete bunker, buried far underground.
At last, tiny robots had carefully drilled through a small shaft and into the mysterious big void.
A couple years ago, muography scans detected a hidden chamber above Khnum Khufus tomb.
He was a mild-mannered and proper Englishman who had immigrated to America from a little village the West Country.
And every word I spoke arrived at the listener's ear in their native tongue.
My luck was as plain as the number on my face.
"Artie, my boy," he croaked, "Always know... where your... towel is..." With one last gasp, he struck me on my ear with a surprising amount of strength.
All the inmates, and all the staff.
He was a direct descendant of Hemiunu, he had said.
I have a whole 100 freckles.
His words came to me in modern English, though I knew he was speaking in his native tongue.
Now up Yes, there -by the drawing of the   white mouse.
I guess that judge was one of those people.
And when the universe was ready, the descendants of Hemiunu must be on hand to ensure the secret was understood.
People want to believe it is possible.
**PART 2:** I sat in the cool air conditioning of the fast food restaurant, gazing out at one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World.
**PART 5:** Buneb had spent his whole young life watching the Great Pyramid, as had his father before him, and his fathers father, and so on back through the millennia.
**PART 4:** I had only had my gift a few years when Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark came out.
The thought made me smile.
But the words had the opposite effect.
And an hour after he banged his gavel, all 100 of my freckles were behind bars with me at Co-Farm Supermax Prison.
Luckily, we were not left wondering long.
When I slept, he would color in between sets of closely spaced freckles, to make two appear as only one.
As my mind trailed off along that thought, I was interrupted by a young man bringing a tray full of enough fat, salt and refined sugar to quell my growing homesickness for a little while.
It is written in columns.
He tasked his offspring with ensuring the language was kept alive and intact.
"It's time," he said suddenly.
It was a stark dichotomy.
But every so often when he had a few pints in him, he would wibble on about strange adventures and heroic deeds in impossible places with fanciful characters.
I glanced at Buneb, the young man from the restaurant.
He managed to become a judge in spite of his lack of luck, though.
Most of us were locked away on false charges.
I had managed to get him hired on as my assistant.
Still lost in my thoughts of ancient times, I reached for my soda before he had finished setting down the tray, and a little spilled.
And of course the first argument I must make is that my freckles are not stolen.
Doctors said his mind was gone, and his body would soon follow.
But from that day forward, archaeology held a special place in my heart.
But we never believed a word of his tall tales.
"I'll finish cleaning up," I offered cheerfully, hoping he would relax.
As the camera finally finished its journey around the room, I stared back at what I had written.
########## I have always been what you would call lucky.
I had been so caught up in my own disbelief I hadn't noticed his face.
I leant in for a closer look.
Youll be able to see the writing in just a moment.
Occasionally I startle people.
Thousands of years ago, a man such as myself may have eaten his meal in this same spot, awed by the view of these same pyramids.
Then he slipped away and was gone.
Somehow I then found myself on trial for the crime of stealing luck.
Those that remained alive out in the free world were forced to flee in terror from the shambling rotting victims of the plague who had succumbed to the disease.
I had spent my entire adult life traveling all around the globe, and yet I still found it surprising to watch the modern world creep into the most ancient of sites.
According to his ancestors, the pyramid held some sort of mystical secret of the universe.
Being a septuagenarian, no one questioned my request for a young strong man to lean on across the sand and rocks.
"**PART 3:** I used my ability to travel all around the world, learning and exploring.
We gathered beneath the large white canopy pitched at the foot of the pyramid.
The virus spread quickly aboveground, and immediately wiped out anyone with fewer than 90 freckles.
As he lay gasping his final breaths, something small and yellow wriggled wetly out of his ear.
Or finding the waters of eternal life.
But despite these trivial annoyances, I grew up the luckiest person anyone I met had ever heard of.
He grasped my head in his hands.
Perhaps our false arrest wasn't so unlucky after all.
My brother, born with 64 freckles, would tease me that most of mine were dirt or insect bites.
Every word I ever heard or read translated itself in my mind.
Its time, said a small high voice.
I was so excited, my heart was beating as fast as the Kali Ma human sacrifice in Temple of Doom.
And our high-res camera has nearly reached the gallery.
It had been converted from a huge government-owned nuclear fallout shelter.
The screen flickered and suddenly it was filled with images.
And now in front of me was a young man who was apparently a descendant of Hemiunu himself.
What had happened to our luck?Each inmate was as confused as the next.
There in my notebook, scrawled in my shaky handwriting, was the ultimate question.
They merely confirmed to his disbelieving ears that he had, in fact, heard what it should be impossible to hear.
It was March 11, 1977.Dad hadn't spoken in days.
His wide eyes remained locked on the great pyramid glowing in the hot sun on the other side of the glass as he shook his head and stammered, "Khnum protect me!No one but a child of Hemiunu has spoken His sacred tongue in over 4000 years!
Very slowly, words began to take form.
My powers of language had never extended to the animal kingdom, but no one was nearby except Buneb, who was intently watching two small white mice scurry up the pyramid.
(Never forget you can make your own luck!
Talking mice, a 2-headed man, poetry so awful it could kill the listener - my best friend Douglas and I teased him that he should write a book or five about it all.
We could not begin to fathom why our luck had suddenly failed.
After all, he only had 16 freckles.
It isnt an answer, it is a question!
My gift granted me access to the most incredible locations.
And now here I was, about to helping explore the first new chamber to have been discovered in the pyramid since the middle ages.
