**SIF:** Actually, no, we don't.
*  **HEL:** It looks like the batter mix you used was contaminated... with cyanide.
We go drinking on Tuesdays.
*Dave stops flailing and opens one eye.
*A sudden thought seems to occur to Dave.
**THOR:** *You're* a remarkably stupid technicality!
"Why?Is there going to be a tiny, fire-breathing quail in it or something?"...
At the front of the room, a man with a white beard flicks at the black eyepatch that he wears.
**HEL:** Well, that's what happened.
"She's four years old!She obviously meant 'Santa!
*Several seconds of silence pass.
"Johnny, now you're in too deep; that fiddle better sing!
*  **ODIN:** Any more like that out of you, and you're grounded!
*All eyes in the room turn to face Odin.
"With a mighty flourish      The Lord began his line      And his fiddle played      A serenade      That was quite divine:  &nbsp;                  [ANGELIC MUSIC PLAYS]                        &nbsp;  When the Lord had finished      Johnny only rolled his eyes      "If that's your best,      "Just take a rest,     "And witness your demise!
*Everyone in the room save for Dave and Hel groans with impatience.
########## The Devil went down to Georgia      Where he got his red ass whupped      Johnny was proud      And he said out loud      "I'll never be one-upped!
"I'm so high, I've been playing the fiddle against hallucinations!
"Johnny said "I'll tell you what, just save those declarations.
**DAVE:** Valhalla looks really boring.
**ODIN:** Now, for the last time: What is a spatula?
**DAVE:** That seems like a remarkably stupid technicality.
**HEL:** According to our charter, a weapon is an object which renders injury or death.
"At the moment?She's riding around on its back."...
**HEL:** It counts!It can render injury or death!
*Dave examines his spatula.
**ODIN:** Well, what's that in his hand?
"That's not really relevant, is it?I mean, yes, obviously she likes it, but..."  ...  "Of course it's a problem!Where am I supposed to keep a twelve-hundred-pound horse?!"...
**DAVE:** Yeah, I'm reasonably certain that pancakes aren't normally supposed to do that.
**DAVE:** It's a spatula.
You're thinking of Jehovah.
*  **SIF:** (*Interrupting*) He told you to go sit on a glacier.
**THOR:** You could have been direct about it.
*  **ODIN:** Enough!I swear, you people will drone on about the dullest things!
**THOR:** No, that's definitely what happened.
*Hel takes out her smartphone and scrolls through something.
*  **DAVE:** Oh, god, sorry, I...     **THOR:** (*Interrupting*) Odin.
**DAVE:** I think I'd remember that.
**HEL:** It looks that way.
**ODIN:** A bunch of old...
**ODIN:** (*In a mocking voice*) "You could have been direct about it.
That is, as I've been trying to say, the reason for my call!Now, can you *please* explain why my front garden has been reduced to charcoal?!"...
*Odin snatches the spatula from Thor and whacks him over the head with it.
*  *Dave closes his eyes and starts waving his spatula in front of him.
**HEL:** We are not concerned with your pancakes; we're talking about the spatula.
**THOR:** This is Valhalla.
**ODIN:** I know it's a spatula... but what *is* it?
*  **THOR:** It's...     **ODIN:** (*Interrupting*) Don't say "a spatula.
**THOR:** I guess your pancakes *were* that bad!
**ODIN:** When *don't* you go drinking?Lazy layabout.
Look, why does any of this matter?
"Sure, thanks, happy Christmas to you, too.
**HEL:** (*Shrugging*) Eh.
**THOR:** He...     **DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) Since he died, I mean.
*  **ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) There I was, thinking I'd be granted some kind of sublime knowledge.
*Odin hands the spatula back to Dave, who looks uncertain.
**ODIN:** You're not getting it.
**DAVE:** Soldiers carry guns!Guns are weapons!
*  **THOR:** You want to go, old man?Huh?
"I'll take the bet,      "But what I get     "Is a day upon your throne!
**DAVE:** ... That seems incredibly unlikely.
**THOR:** Only after taco night.
*A blond-haired man with a neatly trimmed beard sighs.
**HEL:** We had to redefine a pen as weapon a few decades ago.
**THOR:** He actually slipped and hit his head while running away.
So, this really is Hell's telephone number, is that it?"...
**SIF:** Technically, it's an unspecified deity.
**SIF:** He wouldn't stop screaming, so we redesigned Valhalla to make him calm down.
**THOR:** No, not... ugh.
*  **ODIN:** Ow!Ow!Stop it!Stop it!Ow!
"&nbsp;                 Rationality that you can't resist!Jehovah's in a fight with an atheist!All of Heaven's angels start to grieve!You can't beat a man who doesn't believe!&nbsp;  The Lord, he raised an eyebrow, saying "Johnny, you've been cheating!
"Well, Johnny tightened up his strings     He said "Don't make me groan!
When the room's illumination returns to normal, a very confused young man is revealed.
*Thor snatches the spatula from Dave and brandishes it at Odin.
**ODIN:** What troubles you, warrior?
I take it he lost that fight.
'She just can't spell very well!Furthermore, I don't recall the words 'fire,' 'flaming,' or 'total destruction of meticulously maintained property' appearing anywhere in her letter!"...
**HEL:** That settles it.
"But if you lose,      "You'll take a cruise      "Into oblivion!
*  **DAVE:** So, uh... does that mean I'm staying?
*Dave takes a deep breath.
**SIF:** Do you ever say a word so often that it starts to sound funny?
"But as that challenge echoed      Out into the Georgia blue      The Lord jumped in           With his violin      Said, "It's time for round two!
**HEL:** Because a disgruntled accountant stabbed his coworker with one.
**THOR:** Don't encourage her.
"No, I didn't weigh it!It was an estimate!"...
*  **DAVE:** No, I think it's just plastic.
*A middle-aged woman grins with glee.
"'Fluffy Sunshine,' I think.
""That kind of pride,     "I won't abide!
*    **SIF:** Is it forged from celestial iron or something?
**THOR:** (*Muttering*) You mean like trading your eye for a chicken soup recipe?
**SIF:** (*To Hel*) Huh, look at that.
"Well, whether I believe it or not, there's... uh... look, my daughter asked for a pony, see?"...
See, you *don't* have to die in battle; you have to die holding a weapon.
*  **ODIN:** You know, I was supposed to get the wisdom of the ages.
**DAVE:** And... what?You just kept it this way?
**DAVE:** Huh?Oh, no, thanks, but I was actually curious about something else.
"No, I've never been particularly religious, but the presence of a sulfur-spewing equine on my front lawn is making me rethink a few things.
*Odin slams his fist on the table.
