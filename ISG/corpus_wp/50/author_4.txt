Figured I was out of range, but that didn't make sense.
I rounded the corner, engrossed in my quest for fiction, and accidentally bumped into one of them.
I just wanted to get back to the ship.
"I believe I've heard the terms, yes," I replied, trying to not sound sarcastic.
"This is just garbage, garbage I tells ya.
The librarian shushed us on our way out.
There were no parachutes, no way to cancel the payload detachment.
"It's an, errr, *condition*.
"I took some time to process it all.
Saw my team in the distance.
I heard a rustling, some kind of scurrying behind me.
Brushed it aside; nerves were getting the better of me, and there was no use worrying about something I couldn't change.
I'd never been able to talk to girls, not with these two on my shoulders.
Like every bit of primal power focused into a single thought.
He used the same GPS system on the car as the rockets itself, and it was a simple task of linking the two operating systems together.
****  The rockets plunged into space.
He eventually managed to pry his right arm loose from the straps.
"a tiny voice said while I attempted to pick up the fallen books.
His grizzled features only made his eyes more striking - this man had seen some shit.
It wasn't a nightmare, which was rare already; it was more of a premonition.
I ran as fast as I could, praying that it was only one, praying that it could not keep up.
It felt like trapped electricity.
It was just like I said; don't bunch together.
I'd been having a strange dream.
Strapped into the car, the G-force drove him backwards into the seat, sending his cheeks tearing into his face.
"****  Part II will come soon, if there's any interest <3 ########## "Jolly good show, my good man," he said, sitting on the right of my shoulder and inhaling deeply from his pipe.
He typed in his destination, pressed 'confirm', and felt the rockets shudder.
"Watch where you're goin', ya fuckhead!
Furthermore, two more women stood on *her*.
"Or perhaps a delicatessen first?
I doubt youll even believe me, even after what you just saw.
"Looks like you're no fun anymore," he said, smiling wide and exposing his rotten teeth.
"I'd been watching Stranger Things for the last couple hours, trying to block them out.
"What kinda trash is this?
*  What could it mean?Had the Russkies simply lost contact and assumed the worst?That didn't make any sense, since if they landed intact enough to erect the flag, they must have been in communication with them back home...  Something was wrong.
"the man on the left of my shoulder chimed, pacing up and down the length of it.
But he planned to go out in style.
I'd felt a burning sensation in my hand, as if there were energy coursing through it.
****  After much deliberation, the two of them convinced me to go out to the library.
I was still shaking, but he was as calm as an ocean breeze.
Survival is all about laying low, keeping quiet and hoping that luck was on your side.
Rubble collapsed around me as I leapt through a window, landing on the floor below in a clumsy roll.
They seem to be coated in sand - had there been some kind of storm?How long had I been gone for?They didn't seem to be moving, either.
*Why hadn't they told us?
Instead, I just whimpered; the days of relentless torture had left me a shell of a man.
I - or we - were browsing the aisle, Charles trying to direct me to eighteenth century geopolitics, Mike complaining that there were no porn mags.
And judging by my travels, it seems that I am one of the few left with the privilege of choice.
Sleep comes to me eventually, the incessant chittering of the aliens filtering through my dreams of intrigue, of primal power.
His destination was nearing, ever so quickly.
****  If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.
There's some kind of global consciousness that's bringing them into power - we're creating them.
**** ########## I awoke in the night, the distant sounds of screams altogether too familiar.
At his current trajectory, he would forever be stuck in orbit, his corpse withering away in isolation - the perfect crime.
It was immensely comforting; you've never known isolation till you're alone on a new planet.
Again the librarian told them to be quiet.
There was a thick, purplish ooze bleeding out of the leather.
What little sleep I have is filled with feelings of flame and fury; of ominous premonition, of terrifying power.
*  I sprinted from my lair, a crumbling ruin, just as a jagged tentacle pierced through the foundations.
My right hand burned, a sharp red glow emitting from my palm.
It didn't sound isolated - they must have found a safe-haven.
I nodded, still speechless.
"the tiny, posh woman on her right replied.
There were many different forms of alien, and most of the massive ones were slow in the city.
********  The bank teller peered quizzically at my shoulders, and I tried to smile.
Our combined efforts only took down a few, and the ensuing nuclear winter only made things worse.
"The man led us into a nearby bar, ordering two drinks before we sat down.
But if I climbed the building to avoid it, my pursuer would destroy it as if it was a cardboard box.
But deep down, he tasted revenge.
As he felt his suit set alight, as a magnificent house came into view, he could only hope that Musk was home.
A sudden crash to my right sent glass flying just ahead of me.
I suspect that I am going mad, but I'd rather be mad than dead.
It doesn't seem to be for sustenance - they ignore other animals, though they will harm them if it is in their way.
""How did you find out about this?
All the while, he thought he could hear Musk's evil laugh.
*Why are they just standing there?
I stared at the creature that was once my wallet.
I tried to make contact with the boys back at the ship, but there was no reply.
I volunteered to go check it out, though we all knew what it was - and when I'd just confirmed it.
"Fuck me," Mike replied."I...I..."
He pulled out his serrated blade, glinting in the light above the chair I was tied to.
****   |  |   It's a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' story!Vote on whichever choice you like best, and I hope I won't disappoint :)  /r/CroatianSpy ########## I heard the killer's steps echo across the basement.
A beautiful woman stood before us.
Bond knew how helpless his situation was.
Charles leaned over to chastise him.
I whispered for them to be quiet, and in the ensuing silence I heard three women speaking in increasing volume to my right.
I tried to think of some last line to make sense of it all, to die with a semblance of honour.
Bond kept on telling himself it was for the good of the world.
His lungs compressed, then almost collapsed, as his entire being shook.
Musk would have won, and no one on earth would know that their savior was in fact their doom.
And why... why do they look like they're a different colour underneath?Are those- are those *Soviet* suits?
Better if you dont know, he said, looking from side to side, gun still drawn.
"Well, they're coming alive.
A choice:  Shall I **fight**, or **flee**?
"I apologized profusely before security could escort me out.
The feeling still stuck with me, and I focused on it to try drown out the screams.
"Son, I'm not sure if you understand - *every wallet is one of them*.
That's not- that's not my-  *They've seen me.
He finished the last of his drink, then stared at me.
There was no chance of running from it.
Hundreds would be massacred.
