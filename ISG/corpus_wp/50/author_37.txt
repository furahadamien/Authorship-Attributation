Or... had it been real?The sobs slowly started to ease, and I blinked the tears out of my face.
I her for awhile, and then suddenly realized I was shaking uncontrollably.
For a six year old, Marcy was pretty strong.
"I nodded weakly and laid still, trying to ignore the throbbing in my head.
They all had spikes instead of hair, and dots on their faces, and pale skin.
I went back to stroking her hair.
I held my girlfriend tighter, and made a decision.
"I heard a dragging sound, and some stuff being pushed around, and then the clinking of a canteen.""Here.
"Will I ever see you again?
I will always be with you.
"This brought on a fresh bout of tears.
"I passed him the bong, and he took the double hit.
I looked around at all of my loved ones at my literal deathbed.
I looked at the bong again."So...
"It frees your soul from the constraints of space and time, and allows it to fly unbound on the wings of eternity.
It all felt so *real*.The love.
He should be good in about an hour.
"She also took a double hit about an hour ago.
"He snorted and dropped the expression.
It was a green glass bong, filled with a rocky substance and a glowing liquid.
She turned her face to mine."Hey...
The mat I was lying on felt like a sleeping bag.
what does this stuff do again?
"And I just broke right there.
For some reason, I pushed all of that down and grinned at him.
I looked at Rythor and he grinned.
I nodded slowly, and relief filled her face.
She was just like her mother.
Then you passed out for like, 3 hours.
"I eyed Rythor, and a fake, dreamy sage-like expression came over his face.
He took *waaay* more than he should have for his first time, but he took it like a champ.
She had amber eyes, extremely pale skin, and the dots on them made a lovely pattern.
I blinked a couple times and took in my surroundings more clearly.
We need to keep an eye on him.
""Shit, I forgot about that.
Immediately in front of me was Prilana, her eyes still full of concern.
"At least that's what my dealer told me.
"That I will always love you.
I felt a tingle go through my body, and my head started to clear.
I felt my body relax, and everything sank into blissful oblivion.___________________________________________________________________________________________ Troivan?Trovian!TROVIAN!I groaned and attempted to sit up.
My little granddaughter could hold it in any longer and threw herself on me, sobbing uncontrollably.
She was decidedly pretty.
He face swam above my head.
I weakly reached out and touched her chest.
You took a double hit of wastion and started twitching out, babbling incoherently.
I stared sobbing, great waves of grief and confusion tearing through my body.
My voice failed me, so i gestured weakly to about where my throat would be.
"Hush now, my little bobcat.
"She asked between sniffles, her brown hair long and matted from the countless days she sat at my bedside.
"I was suddenly aware that I was holding something in my other hand.
"Not so fast there, my man.
"Well?Do you know who we are?
There was immediate movement, and the second voice floated into my head.
Almost immediately he started twitching, and, after a bit, he laid down with a sigh.
I turned to my girlfriend, and held out my arms.
It was real to me, and that was all that mattered.__________________________________________________________________________________________ Edit: Fixed some formatting, and put a slightly more hopeful ending that I was going to originally put.
He sat there passed out on a mat like I was.
"Just remember, sweetie..." I struggled for another breath, but i had to give her closure.
One of them caught me and eased me back onto the mat I had been lying on.
She was now truly sobbing uncontrollably, her face buried in my chest.
Eventually, she got a hold of herself, the tears held back by an iron will.
"You sure?He looks... well... like he got hit by a Trynagog.
I smiled weakly and stroked her hair.
I can't remember."Hey..."
Her thin mouth and brow were textbook expressions of concern."My...my..."
She didn't want to be outdone.
Rythor, do have that energy drink?
You were on a *biiig* trip.
I surrounded by strange beings.
"A sudden surge of emotions roared through me.
On the far side of the fire sat his girlfriend, Dyenta.
"He hooked a thumb behind him at is girlfriend.
I was in some sort of cavern.
My vision was hazy, but I could sort of make out where I was.
It was decidedly different, but full of motherly concern.
You gotta take a double hit.
I said in a hoarse whisper.
I felt my life slipping away, and I looked in my granddaughters big eyes one last time.
I could see their love, their pain, and their held back tears as i breathed my last few breaths.
For the granddaughter I never had.
"With that I closed my eyes, and faintly heard her starting to cry again.
Was I... camping?My eyes started to clear, and my hearing was coming back.
Pain, love, happiness, anger... but above all was a sense of bitter emptiness, and an indescribable feeling of loss.
"He might not remember everything yet.
I racked my foggy mind, trying to remember who that was.
You took a pretty big hit of those wastions.
"The female... it was coming back... Prilana.
"Rythor spoke up in a cautionary tone.
With a groan, I pulled myself up, gently pulling the canteen from my girlfriends hands and draining the lot of it.
Was she my girlfriend?Friend?Fuck.
If she didn't have it, it would destroy her.
I wanted more than anything to hold her, to tell her everything was going to be alright.
"I lifted her chin gently, her puffy red eyes meeting mine.
So I sat there, under alien sky, weeping for the life I never lead.
"I dimly remember her being extremely competitive.
She held the canteen to my lips and i drank deeply.
I was dimly aware of a warmth coming from my right side.
She came and snuggled into them.
It I was indeed on a green sleeping bag, and a fire flickered warmly in the center of the place.
We were indeed in a cave, or cavern of some sort.
