And yet, as I took in a gulp of fresh air, something felt wrong.
Every single person, object and animal was frozen.
As it turns out, no, I wasnt the one who caused that to happen.
Belatedly, I wondered whatd happen to me if they vanished while the world was frozen.
I didnt know if they could sense me too, the way I could sense them, but I knew that they were out there.
I only noticed when the barista started to move again, the sound of beans being crushed in a grinder giving me the shock of my life.
Yet even as the world froze around me, I continued moving.

They never lasted very long, but I definitely wasnt the one doing it.
The random passers-by were all stuck in time, locked in place, halfway through their last action before the world had decided to stop.
So far, I hadnt seen anything or anyone else move during those freezes.
It wasnt like the first time, when I just wasnt aware of them, no.
In hindsight, that was a mistake.
I screamed, my voice ricocheting and echoing off the tall buildings that surrounded me.
I felt that pulse from the time-stopper grow weaker and weaker, slowly dissipating like a fine dust floating into the atmosphere.
Theres no good way to explain it, but I could *feel* their presence, somewhere, not too close, but not too far away.
I was having trouble sensing the time-stopper.
It was a day much like the one when I had first experienced the peculiar sensation of being the only sentient person in a world of frozen time.
It was as if they were fading away.
Like the dying flame of a candle, about to wink out of existence.
