Its written on every wall.
Maybe its a silk print of Van Goghs starry night and Ive been sleeping atop the swirls of the stars Ive so missed.
whispers Stephens soothing, still-sleepy voice.
Between the layers of denim, cotton, and burlap, my fingertips find the soft silk scarf I carefully place by my head each time I go to sleep.
Thats when I see it: DONT LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.
Even after all this time, the disappointment remains.
Am I fooling myself?Have I lost my mind?Is my imagination playing tricks on me?Its dim but I can make out shapes.
By the 5th blue glow, my eyes are beginning to adjust.
Once more I close my eyes.
Im fine now I keep my eyes closed as I run my fingers the length of his beard once more.
The feeling of the silk pushes me, as it has at every awakening since I found it over a year ago, to just try.
I can see colors!With the rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign the room grows a blue glow through the large wall of windows at the front of the hotel lobby.
As I wake up, I lie on my pile of fabrics fighting the urge to open my eyes, just as I have done for the past 741 sleeps.
Panic quickly replaces the awe Ive just been washed with.
Whats the matter, sunshine?
I hear Stephens low snore like the hum of a bee stuck in a mason jar.
I cannot forget color and curves and faces.
The darkness is comforting for the first time in two years.
I didnt consider how much I would miss the neon red and blue that accompanied the ever-present rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign in front of the hotel room we were in when darkness hit us all.
Its written on the windows.
