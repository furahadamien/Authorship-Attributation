So I get off at the exit.
He looks down and mumbles "There can only be one Jack of all trades, and guess who's gonna be that person" before slyly laughing to himself.&#x200B;
What seemed to be buckets of water instead of raindrops were falling from the sky, wind was howling through the open cracks in my piece of shit work van (I should really get a better one and write it off) and lightning was illuminating the horizon with incredible frequency.
He turns around, pulls out his gun, and pulls the trigger at point-blank range.
I get up and run towards my vehicle, and realized i can no longer drive it.
There is a pause in his step and his head is slightly tilted in my direction.
I need to fight for myself, and my kids.
Before I can even think about this, the skill of plumbing immediately downloads into my brain, and I get a notification: "**WELCOME TO THE GAME, JACK.
I start to clear out what I texted him and start to communicate to him that something has just gone very wrong.
I had just killed a man in a matter of seconds, and I didn't even need to rush.
I look at my phone and stare at it.
There's no way he is alive.
Life has this way of presenting opportunities in the most unconventional circumstances possible, but its time to spring into action.
I could've just gone up Ravenna to East Green Lake Way, and just go up Aurora.
I just killed my best friend.
I can barely muster the ability to hit the brakes in a smooth, consistent fashion and pull to the side of the road.
MAN WAS RESISTING AND TRIED TO TAKE MY GUN.
Big fucking mistake.&#x200B;  I get off the freeway and make my way up Ravenna.
I start to walk away as if I could escape a fatal car accident during evening rush hour in Seattle.
I rewrite "No worries" and send it off.
