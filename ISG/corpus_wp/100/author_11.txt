I changed my mind on the ending too many times, and it's not really that great.
They came back with nothing.
Something had destroyed one of my limbs.
Just dead beings floating in the cosmos.
But in due time, these two-legged creatures would plague them no more.
Billions of years of memories gone blank.
Thousands of tiny cities were attached to asteroids and moons and planets.
Rolling waves of fire and ash covered the surface.
When we got there, the planet was still in ruins.
We did the math.100 Billion, our combined population.
Tiny meaty creatures, with two legs.
It wasnt the two-legged folk.
I resigned myself to my fate.___ If you have any criticisms, please let me know!I'm always trying to improve.
At one point I wanted humanity to be glassed, and then I wanted an ending where they came to a peaceful solution, and then a violent ending with humanity losing, and so on.
We turned away and began to slowly rebuild our population.
Confusion spread, then alarm.
Some kind of new plague?The bravest of us went off to look at the remains of our sisters.
How could we eradicate them now?In every nook and cranny of a star system lay a human settlement.
We kept conducting regular censuses, every [100 years] or so.
From 100 billion, our population for as long as we remember.
