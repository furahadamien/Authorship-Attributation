Youve done so much for me  are you certain I cannot return the favor?
This is the difficulty in speaking with the creatures.
It is a subtle thing, a kind of darker, grey air in a shape that suggests *bird* in my mind  Ive come to call them *airbirds*.Its voice carries though the aether in a way that even an untrained mind can interpret.
Are there none who tell of our first meeting now?
It now resembles an inverted, snow-peaked mountain with many small caves set at regular intervals.
Tiny wisps raise the hairs on my arms as some beings take flight toward me, whipping around me in curious exploration.
The cloud takes on subtleties invisible to the human eye.
My thoughts transform into strokes of an invisible pen, and my new knowledge takes form as a set of instructions.
Let me see if it is possible.
I learned aether-weaving over many generations by their reckoning, and had spent even longer preparing to open the way home.
I cannot actually hear this reply.
My body grows lighter, and I float to the stalactite cloud.
I think this is an answer, I say at last.
I'm very late to this party, but the prompt really stuck in my head.
I am frightened for a minute.
There do not seem to be other beings capable of thought in this realm  of course the airbirds want to meet other people.
They live only a week at best.
With a thought, I conjure a notebook, much like the diary I lost in an endless, waterless desolation so many months ago.
I stand on a cloud, suspended above an endless sea.
I look at the page as I come out of my communion with the aether.
