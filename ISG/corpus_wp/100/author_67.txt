They talk and reminisce about "the old days", and they talk about a day that will never come.
Well, all things considered.
Therefore, my job would give me some sort of purpose.
But now, I've given myself the task to keep these last humans alive.
And they call me, Life- Ha... Haha.
You see, these humans are mixture of false hope and denial.
If I was asked to go to the other side.
But in reality, I'm just, well, curious.
My job used to be simple.
How...Ironic, it is for me.
You see the creator made me devoid of emotion except one.
A little insight on how I was created.
Yet, I somehow admire there hope.
They think they are alive because I am there savor.
However; I don't want to die because...These humans are rather intriguing.
I also learned a couple of emotions recently.
You see I've done this job for centuries now and it would be nice to see what it is like if it were the opposite.
Good thing they keep things...Interesting.
It's also rather falsely placed.
Humor...I think I understand it now.
