But once a mind becomes separated from its body, the protection is gone and it becomes vulnerable.
It was hard to remember the circumstances, but I tried anyway.
Hey, um, can you tell me where I am right now?
Death turned around, then turned again and ran.
I need food too, and you wont escape me.
Maybe there was nothing after death.
You mightve heard of it as dementia.
Death screamed, but it was too late for him.
As it approached, my thoughts, they became more and more incoherent.
They were pulverised in the crash that killed me.
My brain wouldve been dead.
You still havent figured out what you can be yet.
The imaginations were more vivid in this dimension, I thought, before I realised they became real.
You think Id let you play this stupid game?You think I have the time?The leisure?
*Transcendent your human thoughts,* I told myself, *that world doesnt exist anymore.
I thought about what Death had said.
Thinking requires energy, you know, so minds devour other minds for energy.
I was sitting in the car, driving.
No, you are not doing this.
* And for a while, I was a black cloud, unaffected by the laws of physics, able to go as fast as I pleased.
