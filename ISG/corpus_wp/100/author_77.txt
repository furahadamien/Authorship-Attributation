Which explains how she had no idea how she got into the college she did, or that apartment.
She doesnt feel like a villain.
It was for a type of english class, and she needed a newspaper story to write about.
So... then what?Have fun, Talia supposes.
She tries not to cringe as she goes out the door.
She is sitting on the floor of a library, trying to find something, anything, of interest for her project.
Slowly, she picks it up and holds it closer to her face.
What if there are more like this?What if there are newspapers of other villains?The most powerful supervillain.
The headline- it cant be.
and then nothing after that.
Quickly Talia stuffs the newspaper in her handbag.
The Oblivion- a superhero that stopped villains like her by erasing their memory, and everyone who ever knew of them being a villain.
TALIA LIANTRA- THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL SUPERVILLAIN and under that, it proceeds to tell of how she destroyed three major cities, completely and utterly leveling them, and then how shed burned the surrounding areas and other countrysides.
The Oblivion couldnt take anything but memories.
If only she could remember what they are.
The Oblivion is pretty much all that is needed to fight villains.
Talia searches through the remaining newspapers, mostly looking for others about her or other villains, and, finding none, takes one that was adequate for her write-up in english class.
It is mostly under another newspaper, but she brushes it off.
She doesnt have many friends, and had always felt she had less memories than she should.
One newspaper catches her eye.
