I felt like I was living two lives, that I had always been livong two lives.
Then I gasped in a huge breath, my throat burned like I had held my breath for an hour.
I leaned back my head against the wall looking at the single unblinking light on the cealing.
There was a strange beker shaped aperatus in my hand.
I was going to die lonely, miserable, and alone.
I drew in one final breath just as the kah'lorn was peaking.
Thoughts of my parents sobbing over my body flooded my mind, a single tear rolled down my face.
"I thought to myself half caughing half barfing up another hunk of greenish blood.
I was even more confused, I felt my conciousness unlock memories that made no sense.
My stomach dropped out from under me as I realized that though my realities had changed, the person I was stayed the same.
I felt like I was the universe.
I was on a porch of some kind.
My eyes snapped open on a strange scene.
I had never meant for it to go this far.
My stomach spasamed painfully as my vision blurred, corrected itself, and burst into colours.
I finally accepted it, I was going to die.
I slumped against the wall next to the toilet, exhaled heavily, and slid to the ground.
I watched sacred geometry dance before my eyes, unimaginable architecture tower around me, and endless oceans flow below me.
It was becoming more and more difficult to concentrate.
There was alot of green everywhere.
