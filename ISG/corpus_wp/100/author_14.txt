My teeth were chattering.
They never brought it up.
I went to the grocery store and bought rice.
There was a sudden ringing stillness in my body as Opie Daniels stopped, his back towards me.
I dont know how I got home.
There are the bros who are all chest and white teeth, who try to walk right past me and get pissed when I stop them.
When he turned around, he was smiling wide, a giant, mischievous, open-mouthed grin.
Peoples ages popped above their heads just like normal (27, 30, 65, 42), and I checked IDs just like normal.
When he exhaled, I swear he made a noise of pleasure, a low, scraping noise that sounded like, mmm.
Something that belied the smile on his face.
They say fuck this place, bro to their bro buddies when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.
The kids who crack up and dont even try to make excuses when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.
If that was true, I was fucked.
His eyes were dark, sunken and I couldnt look away.
But it makes me a fucking great bouncer.
Opie Daniels lit one of his cigarettes and pulled in a deep drag, deep down into his lungs.
I clenched and unclenched my hands manically at my sides.
Im not sure where it came from.
He was missing two teeth on his upper right side.
Then he pocketed his cigarettes and started away.
