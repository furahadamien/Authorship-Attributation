"She finishes elegantly, saying it with a slight lisp.
Sitting across from a child with crooked and dirty crown on her head as she asks me if I want 'one lump or two' her kiwi eyes blinking up at me questioningly.
But I couldn't admit it to them, I was stubborn, still am.
Anyways, after that night I never went back because my parents are strict, more than strict.
"The Kingdom is doing just amazing, and the people?Oh, even better!
"Oh, just swell darling" I pronounce over accentuated in a snobbish voice making her giggle again.
I had to walk till morning before I reached my older brother's apartment, he moved to the bad side of town because our parents would never guess that would be where he would go.
Giggling she "scoops" two empty spoonfuls of sugar into my teacup before "pouring" tea into it from an empty teapot.
"Well Milady Ellie" she starts before sipping from her empty teacup with flourish, putting out her pinky to show good manners, after all she is the Queen.
Picking up my tea I hold it up to my mouth acting like I'm drinking.
Kids, that's another reason I left to the city.
Getting up I follow her out into the hallway covered in soft carpet before abruptly stopping at the kitchen that has tan tile floors.
Escaping through my bedroom window at two fifteen with only a backpack and the clothes I had on me.
So I left when I found out I was pregnant.
Had twins 9 and a half months later.
The only one who can see me is a little girl, just barely reaching the age of six, with mud brown hair falling in chaotic ringlets and eyes the color of the inside of a kiwi.
"Two, I've always had a sweet tooth" I answer, still trying to figure out what exactly is going on, why no one else can see me except this child.
So I continued reaching for the unseen and unattainable in denial of my idiocy.
I understand what's going on.
I see the little girl pulling on a young woman's pant leg while asking for croissants, mini sandwiches, and other various snacks for her tea party.
