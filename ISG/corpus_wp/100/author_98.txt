What was left of the Sentinel, was a puddle of molten alien metal.
You could feel static in the air.
Nearby a  Senty had rounded the corner, the low baritone humming as it's tracks glided over crumbling walls and rusting cars.
Gemma's lifeless eyes that had once danced with a playful light despite The Day of Broken Skies had wreaked havoc on our broken world under a couple of years ago.

Sophia's sadness had erupted into a deafening war cry.
She croaked out the last of her voice.
She feebly pushes herself onto her knees.
If you had heard her screaming, you would feel the exact moment your heartbreaking into a thousand pieces.
Sophia woke to the sound of metal clanging and water rushing.
Only when she felt searing hot air whoosh past her arm did the ground around her stop pulsing.
"If given the chance she would have sat there and repeated that last sentence over a lifetime.
With every last molecule of her body.
Her eyes pregnant with tears; cascading down her dirty face.
Her migraine made her double over, groaning as she's struggled to make sense of her surroundings.
Sophia struggles to wake.
"She's awake", "she's weird", "she looks like my sister" "she's superwoman" little eyes peered into the safety of Sophia's darkness.
A giant with a barrel chest stoops to let himself into the room.
The dome glistening as it housed this other worldly species.
Instead the ground rushed away from her.
