His hands were gnarled like old tree roots, but still held strength to match that of a much younger man.
YOUR SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON, IN ANOTHER FORM, THAT YOU MAY BRING JOY TO THE WORLD ONCE MORE.
YOU HAVE BEEN KIND AND GENTLE WITH THE LIVES YOU HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF.
When his spirit left his body, it went to where all spirits go when their time on earth is up.
A god who watched over them, who gave both life and death.
He met with all the spirits who he had watched over, and they ushered him on to meet his maker.
*Fin*  Im sorry for your loss.
**   After that, silence.
His smile made the little wrinkles around his eyes deepen a little.
He had helped give birth to innumerable lambs, he had ended the suffering of the hurt and elderly.
To the gentle minds of the sheep he watched over, he must have been like a god.
A sensation of warmth and darkness followed, and Hans was gone forever.
He saw or heard nothing, yet a voice spoke in his head.**HANS.
His eyes were icy blue, but filled with warmth and compassion.
Hans thought to himself, Ive always wanted to be a dog... he felt a tug, then a shift as he left the ethereal plane.
He left behind him the part that was Hans.
Hans had been a shepherd all his life.
His charges were dear to him, like family, and he sported numerous scars from defending his herd from desperate wolves.
The sheep milled around in confusion, but Hans never stirred again.
One morning, Hans didnt rise from his make-shift bed of pine branches.
