I must be in some deep sleep.
Me?What the heck did I do...Here I am standing at the porch of my house, talking to myself.
You're probably just going through a phase.
It wasn't till I reached the door to my house, everything returned to normal.
One *would* go think, even go mad.
Here, someone wanted me to return your phone.
No, don't be an idiot, she has a kid.
DO I HAVE POWERS?I still had the milk, water and the juice.
I'm looking at the beautiful sky.
"My phone?I broke my phone?I thought.
I pull it up, what's my password?Did I have a password before?Is this even my phone?2-5-1-3-2.Nothing happened.2-5-1-3-2.Nothing happened.
I opened the door to go back inside, lo and behold the milk, water and juice had exploded onto the floor and the sofa.
Why was nobody moving?What the heck happened?Wait a minute....**NOBODY WAS MOVING!!
Did the phase start again?Be positive.
No, it's just a dream I gotta pinch myself.
The doors open, I see a kid through the window.
Maybe I just need to clear my mind.
"You would think you have split-personality.
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
You know, I haven't talked to myself this much before.
