Back when I had been a Jack... or was it Jerrell...I had discovered her favorite name was Alex.
I don't know, Alex, what do you want me to say?

"She placed both hands down on the table, apologized once more, and stood to leave.
I had already tuned out her words, and had begun to stare at the eyelash she had let fall onto her cheek.
*This one was no good too?
*I just had to try again.
The first thing I needed to do was buy a new phone.
All of my choices and decisions... she agreed with all of them.
After fifty faces, fifty different lives, what type of person had I not made myself before?Staring at the empty doorway where Amanda had been, I clenched my fists.
Impossible not to admire, I watched and wanted everything about her.
I was the perfect gentleman.
I figured when you stopped answering my phone calls it was through.
""Yes ma'am, I'd be happy to help you with that.
I'm sorry, you're a great guy, just not who I'm looking for.
Her faded silver hair, the freckles on her shoulder, the eyelash on her cheek.
I crafted a beautiful back story about how close I was to my nonexistent sisters.
A new life, a new form, a new number.
"Hi, I would like to buy a phone and look into starting a contract today.
*How do I let him down gently?
