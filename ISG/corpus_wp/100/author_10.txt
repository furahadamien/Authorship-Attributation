I just want you to remember the wreck you left behind.
My *reactions* weren't great, I'll give you that, but the things you did and said  to begin with -- I never ...I'm not the bad guy, and fuck you for trying to make me think that I was.
It's as if I do not know myself without another, without regard to who the "other" is.
But they can never love me in all the ways I need to be loved.
And that's where I wish to be.
I don't need you... and fuck you.
I want you to realize that the only reason I replied to a "writingprompt" to some complete stranger on reddit is because you told me you could never live without me or forget me.
They can tell me time-and-time again how loved and accepted I am, but they'll never convince me.
I've salted the streets in preparation for my upcoming travels into the unknown depths of my mind.
I might have been the bad guy in my past relationships...but not with you.
You were never there.... and never will be, apparently.
With an ever-pervasive sense of hope that only fools relive time and time again.
The only reason I'm typing this out is in hopes that you happen to come across this comment, and recognize how incredilbly hurt I am by your actions.
You won't be this year, either.
The last 20 or 90 months have been covered in ice, it seems.
And it's not exactly mine either.
Yet, time-again, I find myself saying those words again.
The sludge-like snow on the ground obscures my sense of time, or even season.
And a blizzard has been forming in my head for years.
It is there that I await my fate.
