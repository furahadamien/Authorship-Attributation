*The dust begins to radiate and glow green.
The young boy is licking on an vanilla ice cream cone which his father just purchased for him.
*Phyllis' eyes twitch as if there were blinking*  Shooter: Ooohhhh nooo, you may have done got me now.
*  Shooter: Woooahhh woah - I-It's I who, uh - done do it to people in theeese parts.
Her eyes have become extremely dry.
*The shooter hops one foot at a time, landing only on his big toe over to the wallet.
*The shooter sucks in his lips mimicking Phyllis and widens his eyes.
*At this moment a young boy and his father are walking by the bizarre scene.
The blob starts to shrink as it loses its brightness and shift into the shape of a wallet.

*The father switches from a calm composure to a state of panic*  Father: EXPLODY EYE CONTEST!Young boy!Ugmm I mean, Son!We must get out of here.
Phyllis remains unfazed staring back at him.
*Phyllis starts waving her hands above her head mimicking the shooter.
*Phyllis' eyes begin to go bloodshot and she begins to tear up.
