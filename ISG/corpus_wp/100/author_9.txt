Everything I've learned of life since then assures me I was right.
"Turn around, did I find you?
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and given a lot of pills to take regularly.
When I was 15 she told me not to tell anyone what uncle Paul likes me to do with the video camera.
When I was 21 she was all I could see and all I could hear.
She has always been honest with me.
I didn't see her again in a long time.
I rested them in a pint glass and didn't leave the house as I watched them slowly shrivel over the next week.
She hadn't aged a day the whole time I'd known her, but this time half her face was grotesque and scarred the same way mine was, except the opposite half.
She has always been there for me.
When I was 6, she taught me what violence was.
My mother was upset she said why did I throw away my favourite toy.
When I was 25 she came back and I felt a shiver down my spine and I don't know if it was bad or good, but I didn't want to ask her to go away again.
They told me I would be able to talk again with rehabilitative therapy, but that I would be disfigured for life.
When I was 4 years old, she told me Mr Bunny had been saying mean things about me.
When I was 37 I heard a familiar voice behind me, and felt a shiver down my spine.
I walked over to him and kissed him first and it was warm and wet and weird.
When I was 26 she told me that I needed to die so she could live.
They told me she wasn't real.
She said they wouldn't understand, and I was getting too old for it anyway.
