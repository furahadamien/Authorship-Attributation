One of those lame Facebook pranks.
He always used itthere it was!But it was facing away from her.
Just let me help you, ok?
Nothing!Just trying to pour one-handed.
He turned, and her eyes flicked to the cup.
Gemma reached for the cup closest to her.
He tapped the mug.#1 Dad.
Dave half-turned, back still to her.
Gemma whipped the pillow from the bed and in one fluid motion, gathered her infant son from the bassinet beside the bed.
Her left hand deftly swiveled the cup 180 degrees.
Yeah, well..  Yeah, I know.
Philip hasnt noticed, but  Picture after picture of coffee mugs.#2,675 Dad.556,637th Greatest Dad.477th Best Dad Ever.
But the accompanying messages from her friends were real.
Yeah, thanks babe!Come here, mmm She leaned in for a warm kiss, shifting their son to her hip.
At first she thought they were photoshopped.
She rounded the corner at the foot of the stairs and was met with a twinkling smile and his big blue eyes.
Gemmas breath caught in her throat.
All morning shed been getting texts from her girlfriends.
She ran through a list of compliments, distractions, anything to keep him from noticing.
Her hand grasped at empty air as he pulled it towards his face.
