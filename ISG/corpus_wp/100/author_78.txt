You notice that apart from the girl shaking her butt on the loop and doing some weird pose that there was a flash of light at the same timestamp that your precious Matt disappeared.
You fire on the turbo, and make good time.
"A meeting of the world leaders is set via Skype tonight to address the safe return of Mr. Damon, Americas National Treasure" the radio tells you.
You feel alive for the first time in years if not decades.
The door to the box has flipped open like a ramp and crushed your entire crew to death.
He takes a shit on the floor and snorts, while you eat a Fritos corn chip off of your laptop that you found.
The microphone was making a static sound but was still hanging in the air completely still.
One step closer to rescuing Matt.
You are livid it has been approximately 5 hours and Matt Damon is still missing, scared, alone, and helpless.
There is a bright flash on the screen followed by blood curdling screams.
The madness of Matt Damon's laughs is deafening and you inspect the opening of the UFO.
You assure your crew that it was clean, because thats what leaders do.
Did you really stand a chance as cashier to take on aliens that abducted Matt Damon?No, probably not.
As you approach the UFO, you can hear Matt Damon laughing hysterically as if he is being tickled to death.
He commands a human sacrifice daily to eat and inherits your pug, Sexy.
You finally reach LA only to find it burning and looted due to the mass rioting and hysteria of a world without Matt Damon.
You crank it again and the car barely turns over.
In your caloric deficit zombie like state you plop yourself on to the love seat with your big gulp.
The crew needs to be ready for anything, you tell them to keep there eyes open.
It is damp, dark, and moist inside.
