"I'm positively famished.
The whole thing bred a general air of nervousness.
I was nervous all over again as I opened it.
"This man," he gestured to one of the guards "scored 100 in Security, and Luck" Luck is a category on the test?I had never seen that on the lists, and took it for a bluff.
They whole test took about an hour by the time I had submitted my answers.
It was a common childhood insult to be told you'd fail the test and be taken to the dumb house.
"I tried to be forceful about it, but was honestly put off that what would probably be the best guards in the world were watching me right now.
""Let me see my test scores.

""Not like us in this room.100s are rare, and multiple 100s even more so.
But everyone here has a luck score of 100.Luck is a strange category: scores on Luck range between 1 and 75, then jump to 100.We think that after 75 the Luck skill influences its own score.
I had scored 100 in that,Abstraction, Detail, Logic, Mechanics, and Strategy.

We'd never have caught you awake, or by any action that singled you out."Smart.

I dont remeber what happened, but I woke up in an office with armed guards close by.
A shame we were delayed this morning.
My turn came and I entered my assigned testing room.
