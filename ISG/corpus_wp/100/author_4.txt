**Two** light speed jumps?
*Red Hawk*, Im sending Damon back to Earth now.
He presses a button on the command station, and light speed travel is initiated once more.
He presses a button and begins dictating a response.
Alright?Get your squad off my boat so I can enable repair drones.
Nothing around for light years.
Zerk has already begun responding.
Zerk is about to say something when another explosion goes off, this time accompanied by the activation of the ships emergency lights.
Matt Damon hurls as a white light engulfs *XPS412*.When the ship slows down, Zerk looks around.
Zerk waves his hand impatiently, and the message plays.
We are nothing without him, the radio says, before going silent one last time.
A bright flash of light once more.
What the f\-\-  *XPS412*\-\-this is your last warning!Return Damon to us unharmed or we will capsize you.
Zerk's face goes slack, he finally understands.
And honestly, you dont even really get that nauseous after the fourth or fifth time, Captain Zerk explained, passing paper towels to Matt Damon.
Zerk turns off the mic and resentfully removes the magnetic cuffs around Matt Damons ankles.
He smiles, wondering if he will be knighted once he gifts Damon to the Grand Chancellor.
Incoming message, Commander Ze\-  Yeah, yeah, ok play it.
I dont want to be a dick but *The Martian* wasnt even that good, I dont get why youre such a big deal, Zerk mutters.
Collecting Earth celebrities has become something of a hobby among the galaxys elite, who especially love action movies.
