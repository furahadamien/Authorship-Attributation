Right before I open the door I hear yelling, screaming even.
"As the cell door closes, I hear it again.
"the voice in my head asks.
"As I turn around, thoughts start racing through my head.
Too much to keep track of.
I look around, but there's nothing scary happening.
A coffeeshop for fucks sake, whatever would you do with her there?
""You stalked a girl and kidnapped her forcing her to come with you with the knive you had in your pocket.
I turn to look at the girl I'm walking with.
She's staring at me with her big blue eyes while talking with an armed officer.
A man grabs his phone while watching me.
"Hi" "Hi" "Did you find me?
"Did I find you?Turn around"
Men in uniform run towards us.
"Did you really think it was real?
He looks at me and scoffs.
You said she was "the voice" while grabbing her arm and running towards a coffeeshop.
I'm right here"  "ehm, shall we go for a coffee?I would like to get to know you.
Unsure what she meant by that I keep walking, I take her hand, just in case, and make it to the coffeeshop.
Beautiful blue eyes, small face and a sea of hair flowing down her shoulders.
