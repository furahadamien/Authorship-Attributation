Gilberto looked straight into the flying camera of a drone and smiled with all his teeth as he flipped off the camera with both hands.
A whole chorus of other people followed behind, young and filled with life.
I don-, sniffled Emily, huddling into a ball on their plush, living couch that adjusted its feel to your mood.
That was your great, great, great, great, grandfather Gilberto, said Matthew, to his young daughter Emily.
Matthew did his best to not look his daughter in the eyes a moment, and distracted himself from his emotions by watching their ancestor set foot on his new home as an old man.
You know Gilberto, said Matthew, smiling as he remembered all the hilarious videos hed watched of their ancestor.
They nodded, and left to give him more time.
Emily held still a moment, and suddenly became aware of her breathing.

Settle down sweetheart, said Matthew, shaking his head like he needed her to not act like this.
He forgot his pain for a moment.
I was in the wrong star system at the wrong time this past weekend.
Emily studied the redness in the whites of his eyes.
The video showed a man with a goofy smile and the fuzz of a beard growing on his face holding up his camera as he vlogged and pointed at his computer screen at an image of the night sky.
Its only burst blood vessels, said Matthew.
But, all final say, for this brief period of time..
Emily was never one to care much about history.
The man in the video threw some M & Ms in the air, that all clanked one after the other in his mouth.
Almost like if the Toys in Toy Story would stop pretending they werent alive and tried to talk to Andy.
You cant be that way, not if.. Matthew looked at his guards in red, flowing suits approaching from the door, and gave them a look.
