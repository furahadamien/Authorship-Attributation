My desperate, panicked mind came up with an idea...I threw my mother's glock at the security camera, which was surprisingly close to me.
Then one caught me right in the eye.
My powers are so strong that I can negate the defensive powers of my fellow supers just by shooting them with a gun, often to... messy results.
Most people call me the Grey Man.
"One of them, a perky-looking blonde I actually got to know later, and who my girlfriend absolutely *loathes,* asked.
Not a superhero, *the cops*.Still, being an idiotic little boy, I thought my ultra jacked-up superpower immunity somehow protected me from *bullets*.Mundane, ordinary, *completely non-superpower-related lead bullets*.So, I turned my gun on them, instead of running like fuck.

I don't know how I survived.
There were still hundreds of panicked customers in the bank, some of which were injured.
A few bullets whizzed past me, marking the last few seconds of my egotistical delusions of invincibility.
I burst into the bank, taking the glock out of the plastic bag.
She's the only person I really care about, so, well... yeah... publishing this.
It hit, and it completely shattered the camera, doing a lot better than I hoped.
If you're good enough, the public will give you one or maybe even several that will stick, but giving one to yourself is just pretentious.
