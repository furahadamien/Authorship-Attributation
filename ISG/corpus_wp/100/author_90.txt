They brought the axe back up and kept swinging, chopping down the door methodically, over the course of about 15 minutes.
Is it finally over?My phone is still being bombarded, but the knocking has stopped... Maybe another hour or two, to be sure.
Still, it's better than just waiting around listening to the knocking.
I still have my knife down here with me, but hell, if I decide to end it, I want to see what all this was about before I bleed out.
But they looked around the room like they could see perfectly, passing over my hiding place as they searched.
Calling me by name, with a voice I didn't recognize.
I stopped being able to log into steam Tuesday.
Occasionally the knocking stops and I hear the sound of them trying to open the door.
I don't dare to look up, not while I'm looking outside.
At 6:30, the person knocking on my door started talking.
I don't even know the sheer number of people sending me messages.
I sat in the dark, my phone, even set to silent, constantly making noise across the room.
In case they try to break in, I've got my pocket knife in hand.
It hasn't stopped, even though I can see blood at the base of the door, coming in through a tiny crack between it and the floor.
Before long, I fell to the ground, and passed out.
I'm reading to pass time, or playing games.
At 9:45 I heard footsteps in the hall again, then a slam as something hit my door.
Hell, at 11 even my phone went silent.
Their skin was grey like ash, and their eyes were glazed over, like a blind man's.
After a moment, a fire axe slammed through, cutting a hole in the door, and I got my first glimpse of the person who'd been knocking for the last five hours, and I knew the official warning had been right.
