Another terrible mistake....I didn't know where to look.
The green line went right to the pay phone.
Just red...   What I saw blew my mind.
A stunning lady wearing close to nothing came up to us, took our coats and offered us glasses of whisky.
Shaking his hand was at a green-red intersection once.
So I pulled my checkbook out, wrote a check for 20 million dollars and told him 'let me fucking in'   His eyes popped - they always do.
He pulled up in a fancy sports car, and I noticed... the lines didn't intersect.
There were about 30 people, wearing nice clothes, surrounding a ring.
Walt asked him to give the tour to me.
The lines would intersect - like the time I shook hands with the sketchy oil businessman in the Middle East or the time I decided to speed away after hitting that guys car.
He looked at me strangely and said 'everything all right bud?
I was coming out of prison and the red line went left with the bus leaving prison.
And that's all I needed in life.
!Let's go!Get over her you sunofabitch you...I walked over and the yelling made sense now.
They were all men, yelling and drunk.
I was nervous but decided to get in the car.
The governor asked me where I wanted to go.
I was too good at this and missed the thrill, the exhilaration.
So I asked, how much for platinum?He smiled, and said 'you can't buy platinum.
But the line led to a door that was closed.
