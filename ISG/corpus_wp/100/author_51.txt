Pup-pup sighs and she stands up on legs I remember my mom saying she used to knock out from under her when she was actually puppy size.
I wag my tail for her, but she doesnt seem to see.
I turn my head to look up at my human.
I nudge my human again, and Pup-pup reaches to take my collar.
I lay with my head in my humans lap, her long-toed paw curled like a bird foot in the warm spot under my ear.
My tail wags reflexively, but I dont move.
Pup-pup takes my place beside her.
Instead, he sits beside Pup-pup, and Pup sits on my side of the bed.
He drops my leash and I jump up on the bed again, moving to my humans other side and snuggling up tight against her.
I whine again and nose her side.
My humans paw tightens and she coughs, loudly, with the rasp of fresh-clipped nails on hard gray ground.
Pup-pup takes hold of my humans bird-like paw and holds it between her young ones.
Or something close to thatlike stars, theyd always been and always would be.
Missy, come, Pup-pup says and when she pulls on my collar, I move to the flooraway from my human.
Her eyes have taken the milky white my mothers eyes did before she was taken away.
My humans, because Pup-pup is mine, too, even if this human under my paws is most my human, have always buried their short muzzles into my shoulder when the eye-leaks start.
I glance at her, but she doesnt make me leave.
She stays still, and so do I, even when the other humans walk out, brushing their paws against my fur.
Pup had used the great air-sucker, the loud one I learned to bark at because my mother barked at it, too, to take away the fur that had clung to the soft insides.
When her chest doesnt rise again, mine does.
