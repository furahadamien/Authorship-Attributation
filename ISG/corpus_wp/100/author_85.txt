It's a color that our brains just make up.
I'll live out the rest of my life on Lunar Base Seven.
Ghosts are not the top of their food chain.
It turns out that everything they've got on what they use for a color wheel is right there in *their* rainbows.
Better to rule on the Moon than to serve in Hell.
We see an imaginary color.
Better still, don't *have* any.
Someone has to *not be surprised*.There's a color on the color wheel that's missing from the rainbow.
That's a purely terrestrial defect.
Anti-green, in our circular way of thinking.
I'll be the first to make a permanent home up here.
We weren't alone long before the Conglomerate made First Contact.
Ghostly-colored things are all around you.
Our Friends from the Conglomerate see things more clearly.
I hereby formally resign my position and refuse to return to Earth.
Just find a way to beg, borrow or steal some tech that'll let you detect the Ghoosha.
For the rest of this life, and hopefully for all of the next.
As for me, I'm here to stay.
They don't have a magenta.
So of course I'm not surprised when, once again, I accidentally discover that we're not alone.
