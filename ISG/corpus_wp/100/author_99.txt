I hope I formatted it properly.
We used to wonder where dark matter came from.
The world panicked and prepared for a war we knew we couldnt win.
When we entered into the Earthless dimension, we found what we had come for.
People lived and died with no other goal or dream but to reach magical worlds.
But there was a reason no dimension had all five elements simultaneously.
They withered and faded in its presence.
When all five interacted, they became unstable.
But we were obsessed with the idea of magic.
Generations of scientists dedicated their lives to finding a way into another dimension.

We need not have worried.
What was once a fantasy was now too much for us to resist.
When the Waterless came to our dimension, it was the first we had heard of the fifth element.
When the Fireless came, those beautiful crystalline beings, we tried to warn them, but our warnings arrived too late.
When the breakthrough finally came and we found a way to breach the boundary between dimensions, humanity would tolerate no delays.
The Earthless were like friendly spirits, traversing life and space as an ethereal combination of magic, water, fire, and air.

They couldnt exist in balance.
It crashed into us like a wave, filled us with power, echoed like a thousand songs through our hearts and our blood, intoxicated us like no drug ever could.
