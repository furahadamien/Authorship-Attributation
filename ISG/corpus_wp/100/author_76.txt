About the nature of time, about me, about yourself.
Do you feel it too?That pressure in the back of your head?I do not suppose you do.
You might hear from me again.
How did it start and why does it happen to you?I don't want to give too much away right now, as it would endanger some people.
Brilliant!I suppose you have questions.
They tried to find you, but they never did: another accident occurred.
How long has it been?Roughly two years?Yes, that sounds about right.
Still I'll tell you this.
As you might imagine, I am not yet willing to give you everything.
I'm glad you reached out to me.
I wonder what mischief you did.
I have quite mastered by now, but takes a toll on me.
You were collateral and absolutely random.
At least after the few initial and totally understandable breakdowns, that is.
A fanciful post in a popular internet platform.
A side thing for now, but who knows?I could very much use the talents of someone like you.
And considering you have no idea when it happens it's the only thing to do.
Think solving equations while lifting weights and trying to dictate a groceries list.
Trying to figure out the type of person you are.
I am turning this into a profession.
