The visit went well enough, they just sort of danced around a bit.
There were no signals from anywhere else in the world.
It was stocked with everything we'd need for 75 years for 1000 people.
The ones with too much luck, apparently.
I've won the equivalent of 25 people's college tuition from half court shots.
Nuclear waste wasn't buried as deep as we were.
It was all a bit ludicrous, actually...the g-men in their black suits with automatic weapons, the excessive security.
We were the "lucky one-hundreds".The ones with unbelievable luck.
I'd won the lottery 7 times, the Masters three years running (because there were the only times I'd competed) and so much more.
We had about 53 souls in all.
Here we were, stuck in a bunker... with the Brazillian Bikini Team, having to restart the world's population.
Today was visitation day.
Being as remote as e we were, we could cut it down to 15.We also came to find out, this was the US Congressional safe bunker, because, where else would you want to be when the crap hits the fan than with people like me?Well, it seems that luck only applies when you are where we are, so not a single official made it.
Grabbed by men in vans and hoods thrown over our heads and whisked away to this "undisclosed location".I was here because I was too lucky.
We came to find out that everyone outside had lost their damn minds and every leader who had them launched every flipping nuclear missile they had.
(I guess they had alternates, too?
)Just after they got into the complex, the lights flickered.
Somebody, perhaps some high powered politician hoping we'd be of help to him if we ever got out of here, had arranged a visit by the Brazilian Bikini Team.
The deep elevator that went down level after level to a giant vault door to where they kept us.
The whole world outside was uninhabitable, at least for the next 20 years.
