I looked at my husband and daughter having breakfast, but they seemed oblivious to the writing.
My short brown hair was standing up in all directions and my eyes looked crazed, but thats not what caught my attention.
I dont even remember when he left, just that hes gone.
* The letters danced before my eyes.
I just think it was trying to tell me something, like what would happen if we just keep going like we always do..
I stopped one of them and opened my mouth to say something.
Although there were not many further news reports I just knew with a certainty that a whole species going blind at once must have cost hundreds of thousands of lives, if not more.
What was happening?I ran down the street.
Dreams were crazy in hindsight, especially without the emotions associated with them.
The words haunting me everywhere.
On the windows of stores selling electronics for entertainment, with graffiti on filthy walls, even on the side of dumpsters.
I got up and walked over to my partners chair and stood behind him.
I heard his sharp intake of breath and he stood still as I whispered softly, You know, youre right.
You know it sounds crazy when you tell it like that right?Just dont go telling your boss you want changes, next thing you know youll be fired.
I walked closer to the window, my head slightly tilted and looked at myself more closely.
I caught my reflection in a window and stopped.
I looked at him and realised what I had been telling him.
Realisation hit me a moment later.
The world had gone blind.
Dont tell who?See what?I sipped my orange juice and felt like there was something I should remember.
