Today it was a deep burgundy.
The red line, it always laid there taunting me.
I continued to walk until there was a doorway, I walked through wondering what I got myself into.
Everyone get different colors, different paths, but you choose on your own and nobody can tell you which is right.
I could feel the red line under me with every step I took and watched the green line fade.
In the last week the call was becoming louder and the line was darkening.
The lady at the desk handed me a computer and told me to take a set and handed me a small index card.
She asked what color lines I received.
No ground below, no sky above.
I read the card   WELCOME TO THE AFTERLIFE.
I started seeing the lines when I was young, I was around twelve or thirteen, just hitting that wonderful stage of rebellion.
I continued walking forward and found myself in complete white.
YOU ARE GIVEN TWO PATHS: LIFE OR DEATH.
Today I decided to shift from green to red, I stepped towards the red line and as I did the green line went to a bright lime green almost as a warning.
As I sit in this office looking down at the people walking below, I know I chosea good path, but did I choose "The Right One"?Sure I have money, a great job, big house, too many cars, but the boredom is killing me.
YOU SURVIVED EARTH FOR 32 YEARS.
I've spent nights awake thinking of it.
I kept feeling the red line calling me, asking me to try the other side.
I asked my mom about them, she hesitated.
The room was bright and cheerful, painting of beautiful landscapes on the walls and plush leather couches.
