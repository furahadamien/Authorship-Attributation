He had relaxed while reliving these thoughts over the past 45 minutes while final preparations were made.
Alas, nobody could hear his screams.
He opened communications with Cadet Bonespurs one more time, "Hey, make sure you wave to our employees on the moon and Mars when you pass by!Yes, they're already there.
"This last remark sent Trump into a rage.
He thought about the possible consequences and reactions over the past month as he customized this latest Space X rocket, fitted with 4k HD screens that would broadcast every second in every angle pre- during and post-launch.
At least you got one thing right, but nobody will ever know!
!I'm the President!I'm President Trump!
It took Elon another minute to contain himself and stop laughing.
Opinion polls started to cover the public feud months ago, just as it seemed the Russia investigation was ready to charge Trump.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he watched the Cadet.
Opening broadcast communications required a hand size of at least 7.44 inches to be scanned.
Maybe Cadet Bonespurs (finally, a nickname stuck, thanks to Senator Duckworth) thought another fight on social media would draw press and conversation away from what he had done if he escalated the altercation with Elon.
Elon Musk was never known to be particularly vindictive or violent, but that Twitter war started by Donald "Cadet bonespurs" - oops, J.- Trump was pushed him over the edge.
A smile crossed his face.
Then he pushed the button.
It was just Elon Musk once again outmaneuvering Trump's tiny brain and tiny hands.
But I always thought it would be cool to say that," replied Elon Must in a snide yet humorous tone.
He knew Trump would believe anything at this point.
Musk thought about everything Trump had done and said that led to this decision, to kidnap Trump and launch him into space on a one-way trip.
He was every bit as calculating as he had been and knew he was right, the last thing Cadet Bonespurs would ever hear would be applause from Earth.
