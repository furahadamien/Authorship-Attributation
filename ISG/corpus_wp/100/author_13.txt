Just try and turn a radio or TV to a news station and await further instructions.
"I can't see something blinded me this morning as the sun rose.
It's what we use along with scent to hide from predators mainly packs of wild dogs and occasionally escaped zoo animals.
"I'm blind as well and so are all of our emergency service workers.
I don't even know how to tell people where to go!
They latch there tendrils onto the faces of those nearby.
Pumping something into us.
On the walls of the store I'm hiding in there are two messages.
It's like the blinding light from before.
I open my eyes to find darkness.
It's a normal night like any other.
What in the world happened that day.
I put them on my face and I pick up my walking staff.
They know is all I can think.
Soon it finds me soon it drags me from the store.
Floating orbs with what seems like endless tendrils.
I begin to have a headache.
She sounds just as scared as I am.
Don't let them know you can see and beware the drones.
I try covering my eyes as they're closed yet they're still burning.
