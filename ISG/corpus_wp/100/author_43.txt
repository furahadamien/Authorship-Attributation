I stood still for a moment, then simply brought a chair from another room and sat down quietly next to him.
Not like I could do anything more elaborate anyway, since I never knew when the time stops were coming or how long they'd last.
The longest one was about three hours.
Since time hadn't returned, I followed it.
The first time it had happened was months ago, and only for a few shocking seconds.
I knew somehow instinctively that I wasn't making time stop.
And to her left, a man sat in an uncomfortable-looking chair.
We looked at each other in silence for a moment, then he looked away, his hand resuming stroking her hair.
Once a day, then twice a day, sometimes three or four.
I was on day three when I found the room.
He didn't acknowledge me.
Like he'd been crying for three days straight.
Inconvenient at best and downright boring at worst.
To her right, a doctor stood, his hand poised over a silent machine.
After six hours had stretched on with no end in sight, I decided it was time to make good on my threats.
Whoever it was didn't do a time stop very often, and they didn't manage to get me when the time was wrong, so it didn't bother me much.
Or would it be more accurate to say three "days" ago?The time stops started picking up frequency over the last few weeks.
A woman lay in a hospital bed, tubes sprouting from seemingly everywhere around her.
I remember being afraid I'd had a stroke or something, but I never got it checked out.
It took a bit of calming down and being focused, but I finally felt an odd feeling, like a compass needle pointing me in a direction.
