"Lust laughed, and looked at Pride through half-drooped eyelids, "Oh, I love it when you delude yourself.""Quiet.
"This is just like you, Envy," Lust rolled their eyes.
""Glad you asked, Sloth!Earned Pride is what happens when you are Prideful of what you have accomplished.
"Everyone turned to look at Pride.
"Greed chuckled, "Yep, and that is making a ----ton of money.
""Oh please," Lust said, lounging back, "there's a difference between love and lust.
""Excuse me-"  "Can we talk about that?
"Pride just had this whole entire month to themselves!
"Gluttony cut off Pride, and quivered their jowls furiously at Envy and Greed.
Similarly, there's a difference between Earned Pride and," they gave a knowing grin, "Unearned Pride.
"You know," Lust purred, "you're not helping your case.
""Yeah but I gotta share all that with Greed!
"As much as I would *love* to have an entire month dedicated to myself, I can't actually take credit for that.
"Wrath huffed at Greed while the others continued to argue.
"There was a moment of silence.
"Pride gets a whole month to themselves, and you get all bent out of shape, despite you already having the entire season from Thanksgiving to Christmas.
""You gotta admit," Lust purred, "It's pretty impressive the way you drive the mortals into a frenzy like that.
""Wait-"  Envy pushed in, raising his voice.
*My* month!You've taken Black Friday and started pushing it into Thursday!
"As much as I *hate* that you're taking up more of the mortals time, at least you're not a lazy ---- like Sloth!
