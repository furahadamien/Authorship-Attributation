Lily is my current target, I sense her life will shortly end but she is only 34 years old.
The people know very little about me, they seem to react to my presence which I assume has to do with how weak I currently am.
This is how my lifes been these past few years.
Lily, if I were to have continued my old work she would have been dead by now.
When the population had dropped down to about 50 I was barely able to keep my self in this realm.
I am not able to foresee their exact deaths but I can do a little bit to help them.
But that isnt the new me, now I have to make sure these people survive.
She fell face first into the dirt and I felt slightly sorry about causing her pain.
I notice up ahead there was a few trees.
Its been a few years since the bomb that wiped out 99% of the human race went off.
I heard a faint thank you as Lily got up and brushed off her knees.
The tree fell with a loud crash directly above the spot Lily was going to.
Helping people and hearing them thank someone they cant see makes me feel sorry for them.
At first I was continuing my job of killing people but I soon came to realize how weak it was making me.
They gave me a name of life but if only they knew who I really was.
My life depends on their population not dying out.
Would I have had her kill herself?I may have even had her get hit by a public bus.
Ive had to make it my new goal to make sure these people survive as long as possible.
Without my help the humans were able to get a little bit more population and my energy has slowly returned.
But now with a little over 200 people left on this planet I must keep them alive.
