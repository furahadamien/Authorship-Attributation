He looked up at Adolf expectantly.
Gingerly, he dipped his brush into the primer and began to spread it all over the canvas.
Adolf nodded and picked up a two-inch flat brush.
He slammed the door behind him with a loud crash!
In one swift motion, he removed his brush from the perfect pool of pretty paint and onto the canvas.
Relax, the man said calmly and added, Im not judging you for your painting, take your time, Adolf.
The strange man pulled off his hood, but kept his hat on.
The stranger stood up and began to rustle through the paints and brushes that had sat untouched over the past few days.
Adolf obeyed, slowly mixing the paint.
Adolf moved aside to let the man in.
Soon, the whole canvas was covered in a sea of beautiful blue.
In bold letters, the headline practically screamed, Wien ist heute die viertgrte Stadt der Welt mit zwei Millinonen Einwohnern.
the figure said, sternly.
He walked over to his easel and stared at the empty canvas.
Ive been trying to get into the Academy of Fine Arts here in Vienna for a while, but I havent been accepted Adolf sighed and pressed on, they said that I lack technique?
He picked up the freshly primed canvas and rested it on the easel in front of him.
Ja, I do, Hitler said dismissively.
Have you applied to any art schools lately?These are fantastic, the man asked as he rifled through a pile of sketches on his desk.
He flipped through it and one particular yellow stained, wax sealed envelope caught his eye.
Adolf was finally relieved when he spoke.
