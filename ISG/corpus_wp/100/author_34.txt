I pick out my clothes (a new dress, a new pair of jeans, and a hat) when no one can look at me or speak to me.
How am I supposed to use my power when I have to worry about him?He steps out onto the road where cars are frozen at forty-five miles per hour.
You never know when the cars will start moving again.
He lets out a heavy sigh.
I just wanted to buy some new clothes, but its a day when everyone comes.
I slip around people and head off to Macys.
Social anxiety is a bitch, but this thing makes it easier.
I brake and manage to stop.
Car went straight back to sixty but I wasnt controlling it...
But when Ive gone just a little ways away, I stop and look back at him.
My wife died in the accident.
You already figured out you shouldnt get behind the wheel of a car, didnt you?Whatever weird quirk of the universe this is, we just gotta live it out.
Soon enough, Im putting the bag in my purse and then hopping on my bike.
Hes at least a decade older than me.
Everyone freezes for a few minutes or a few hours... and then it starts again.
Around me, the world is still frozen.
I feel like I cant breathe.
Ill never know what situation hes in.
Time stopped, my car stopped... but when it started again, my hands were off the wheel and I was looking out the back window.
My freezing and unfreezing time could kill him.
