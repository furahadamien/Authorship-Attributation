Paved roads, houses rebuilt.
I heard strange noises from the sky.
The lucky ones who stocked up on canned goods probably fared better.
It was a short man with a bushy beard.
This is a whole new world I've opened my eyes to, and I plan to survive and see it through.
For two whole years I lived like this.
I don't know what other people did.
I could feel my skin grating against the concrete while her knee was pressed into my back.
Technology like that was probably in development long before; you know how there's always research and development going on?Bah.
I assumed everyone else had a similar tattoo.
"To prevent me from following he pulled out a gun, aiming it at me until he was far enough.
The creature was descending.
I heard cars collide into objects, people, animals.
"That took her by surprise and she withdrew her weapon.
"I felt the urgency of his words and was too afraid of being roughed around to protest.
You PUPILs won't stop until we're all dead.
"I have the suspect secured.
Where do you live?I'll escort you ba-"  "No need.
For dogs I cuddled them, covered their muzzles when they found trust in me, and I would take my kitchen knife and gut them.
"The 'sighter' protested.
Growing up in the Caribbean this form of 'punishing therapy' was unheard of.
The sweat on my face allowed small pebbles to stick to it.
It was as if I was born again.
"You shouldn't have let them know you knew about the Great Blinding.
"She slammed her gun into my head so hard it bounced against the floor and I passed out.\[3\] **PUPIL**  I was aroused to consciousness when I heard the sounds of violence.
Was it more of those soldiers?I heard a body drop, then gunshots.
Someone killed themselves, I believe.
Then she circled around me, stopping in front of my face once she did not see my eyes connect with her movements.
I'mguessing that people began to adapt to sightless travel?Who knew.
I had no hopes of winning this fight.
Finally she pulled out her hand gun and I faced the business end of the nozzle.
She got out a pair of handcuffs, which I knew because of the sound.
They're rounding us up and feeding us to 'it'.But we are resisting that.
He covered his eyes and threw me a knife, "You let it know you can see.
Don't tell who I can see?Who are they?Who is them?It wasn't anyone in the food store, was it?No.
I feigned blindness, turning my head to face the sound.
I'd imagine there wasn't much people left on my island.
It's dangerous out here, we have hijackers and robbers.
"\[2\] ***Seeing blind - 2 years later***  &#x200B;  "Don't tell them you can see" was sprayed all across the walls in my living room.
But that only happened for a month.
Actually, none except for an argument over who got the last tomato paste.
I could feel the hairs on my chin itch at the thought of everyone being rescued, and then brought into what?I dismissed the thought as childish wish-fulfillment.
I looked down at the knife, and then I thought to myself *I have little choice but to fight.
It was hot, my skin was broken and bruised, I felt pain everywhere.
Someone came in my home and vandalized it.
"Don't tell them you can see"?I repeated out loud.
She put up her hand and waved it in front of me.
She has seen violence and has committed it as well.
I would venture out into the open, occasionally someone else would be on the streets.
So we were sighters now?It's amazing the things we invent to disregard humanity, then apply onto one another.
And then, my eyes opened once more - "Don't tell them you can see.
I would lure animals into my home and butcher them.
What in the hell happened?The sun's brightness irritated me for a while until I truly adjusted.
The air smelled pungent and sour.
"The voice was warm and authoritative.
I pondered what it meant, tugging at my straggly beard, reminding me I needed a shave.
Like us, you are a 'Seer', and not a 'Sighter'.We're all over the globe.
'"called out a heavily armed man of a large muscular build.
I wasn't sure this was a permanent phenomenon.
"She took me by the arm and subdued me on the ground.
I was blind before The Great Blinding.
&#x200B;  \[1\] ***The Sightless - 2 years ago***.When I was a child my mother would instruct me to put on blindfolds when I had uncontrollable tantrums.
After a solid minute I stood still looking around aimlessly.
""W-what?I-I can't see, I swear!
Someone else and another and more have thought the same as I did.
But then the streets began to smell cleaner, the air smelled crisper.
She took a step closer until I said, "Who's there?
I turned around to face my rescuer.
"Secure the area and round up all of the 'sighters!
There, behind me, was medium framed female with plump lips with a thin scar across the top and bottom.
I fell back and observed behind an obstacle.
Bodies were here and there, and I knew this.
I picked up the knife and examined it.
But that was the beginning.
I took as much ravioli and canned soup as I could manage and carted whatever I could back home.
You're making this harder for all of us.
What saved my life was "Don't tell them you can see" which I remembered intimately as it was a great trouble to remove it from my wall.
Where other kids would get a stern lashing that multiplied by the crescendo of anger, I was given exercises to manage myself.
Where was I going to be taken to?I had no clue.
I didn't discard my stick, I kept it on my back as a sort of relic to ward me from the evils that could be reality.
Fearing that I was next I avoided sight until I bumped into someone.
"She said into the comm, then turning to me, "We're going to find out everything we can about your organization.
Two women, a boy, and three other men.
We are anomalies!We either become them or stay like us, but once it knows you can see it comes after you.
I noticed the rescuer had a tattoo of a crying eye on his neck.
The radio you heard was us.
I thought to stand clear.
I'm not sure, but four months later I that the light in my eyes opened while on a walk.
"Shouted the bearded saviour.
Have you ever fell in garbage before?6-months into the second year of the Great Blinding I noticed I heard sounds that were alien and familiar at once.
As I turned my head around I saw what IT was...A large chirpoteran creature with tentacles standing in place of its face and human arms wrapping around its torso was flying through.
Then I felt a strong grip grabbing my bicep, pulling me to my feet.
There wasn't much fighting.
He had several other people behind him.
People who wish to do you harm.
"Man you can't do this to me!
You must come with us, we'll tell you the rest along the way.
I carefully avoided them the best I could but would sometimes run into one and fall.
It wasn't until the morning 4 months later, I think it was four.
I tried to resist but only because the floor was hard and it was hot.
