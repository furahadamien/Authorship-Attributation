"Maybe I should check on George first.
You've sent the medical labs into complete disarray.
That wasn't to mention the vomit he was cleaning up, the coughing fits he helped them through and the gallons of soup he had prepared.

"Wait," George said, "So what you're saying is that we're safe unless we get infected with separate viruses at the same time?"
Fred rubbed his forehead and held her hand until she felt better and leaned into him.

Fred raised his eyebrows then followed George's amused eyes to the sofa where Bianca had fallen asleep, body half hanging off the sofa, lips slightly parted.
"You really think they're trying to bring him back?"
Her eyes were all glossed over and unfocused.
