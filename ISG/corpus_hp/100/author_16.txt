Harrison strolled into where the basilisk herself resided in with her eyes closed once more.
"Potter, what's the three unforgivable curses?"
He paused, mulling over the idea, but curiosity won out his self-preservation, and he entered.
Ron sacrificing himself on the chessboard.
A nice challenge really, considering the disappointment of everything else.
Those were words that always echoes in his head as he tried to sleep peacefully at night but he knew he couldn't get a peaceful rest not until he could get them up.
Always living in his brother's shadow.
He gave a shuddering breath that rattled his bones and everyone else's.
He found a small bookshelf in the back of the room that he would've missed if it wasn't for the light coming from his wand which Harrison picked up a book hidden behind a few books which made Harrison raise his eyebrow, curious of why this book was hidden behind the books as if no one should know of its existence.
Malfoy looked at him curiously, shaking the hand.
Harrison looked at the prodigious snake with its dark, green scales reflecting in the poorly lit room but she was a beautiful snake though.
"We didn't have…" "…to come here and give you the…" "…little titbit of information we've found."

The fool was finally dead and he couldn't be more happier about it.
Sirius remained quiet with Harrison gobsmacked at his idiocy.
And then it was all back; his posture, his mask and his 'mad' glint in his eyes.
Harrison been alone for his whole life he has been alive with only the darkness and the death eaters as company but they weren't there.
It wasn't his fault that he had these issues and that his godfather didn't know about the truth that hid beneath the Potter Manor's walls.
It's about time, he thought.
