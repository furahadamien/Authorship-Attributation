In every moment that had passed since being forced to hold one side of an International Portkey, he'd been consumed with thoughts of what their life could have been like.
In the next, he'd worried that there was someone acting as a father to his son, and it filled him with rage.
But his foot slipped as he stepped off the stool, part way through a motion of making a show of how he was fucking fine.
Apparently, Potter gathered all of that information from one look at his face.
That wasn't to say he hadn't visited for the sake of his mother, but the wing in which Granger had writhed on the floor—where his mother had always used—was off limits to him.
"I thought that would be the case.
We will get back to Hermione next chapter, which is also when we will see her point of view as well!
I'm putting in a notice of leave."
"I'll start the paperwork for you to assist with the French Ministry.
His fingers traced the words.
"She's clearly been Obliviated!"
Robards came around his desk to stand between them, laying a hand on either of their shoulders.
"You've always been the best of me."
Draco bristled as Robards clasped his hands and hunched over in his chair.
Swoop in to heal her broken heart, was that your plan if she wasn't single?"
A heavy sigh filled the air.
There was a thud as his tumbler came to rest against the table.
"Are you sure you don't want a Sober Up Potion?"
It would eviscerate her mind, and as such, it's a risk we're not afforded.
The Minister and I both believe that she's been Obliviated, likely by Lestrange, but we can't prove that until we send a team to France.
