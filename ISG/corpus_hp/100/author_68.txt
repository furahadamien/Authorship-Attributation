Of course, they'd been holding hands too, which Remus didn't usually do with his friends.
"Let us by," Sirius's voice was harsh as he stared down the two boys.
James shrugged off his cloak and softly wrapped it around her shoulders.
Lily roared with laughter, and Remus, unable to help himself, joined in.
He didn't usually discuss his family with people outside of their small friend group.
Lost in thought, teeth still chattering, he started when something soft slid around his shoulders, as they turned the corner to enter the village.
Besides, he tried to clear his thoughts, it was absurd to think that Sirius might fancy him.
Sirius tilted his chin up, his black eyes full of worry, forcing Remus to meet his gaze,"Remus, I know.
He hoped this wasn't just a dream.
Remus was at a total loss.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that James had done the same.
Sirius had also stopped walking as they stood directly in front of him, blocking their way forward.
Sirius's arm was slung across his waist, pinning him to the bed.
Remus eyed her closely...was it possible...could it be...that she was starting to see James differently?
He was an embarrassment to Gryffindor.
Sirius, still arguing with James, had gently draped his crimson wool scarf around Remus's neck.
I have regards for you from a friend of my father's - Fenrir Greyback, I think you know him?
I don't know why we didn't think to do it sooner."
Sirius laughed at something he said, and Remus felt his stomach clench, as he saw her reach out and rest her hand on Sirius's arm.
Without waiting for Remus, he turned on his heel and marched off through the snow back towards the castle.
