Over the past two months, the skinny boy had begun to spend more and more time with the other Gryffindor first years, and he'd eagerly contributed to the planning and execution of that evenings' prank.
"Yeah, awesome," he returned after swallowing the food in his mouth.
His voice was soft and had a slight waver in it.
However, Lily, who was focused on her dinner, simply ignored James' question.

She stopped at each student and handed him or her a piece of parchment.
I know Dumbledore said that we weren't allowed to practice magic in the hallways, but if we're careful and people don't know that it is us that is doing it, we shouldn't get too many detentions.

It all made sense and he could perform most of the spells with only minimal practice.
Immediately, it brought the librarian upon the boy who had been startled by the sudden appearance of flames at his table.

He then quickly began shovelling food into his mouth.
Peter, on the other hand, seemed to have not managed anything as his ice quickly melted.
The boys, along with the other Gryffindors and the Ravenclaws, filed into Transfiguration.
She then continued on down the table.
James was a little worried, but this wasn't the first time that Remus had pulled away from them.
In Potions, James had switched Snape's crushed leeches for lacewing causing his potion to emit a dark, pungent smoke.
