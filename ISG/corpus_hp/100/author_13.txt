Hermione countered in the middle of his attacks with charms.

"You dirty, evil bastard."
"Mitsy I will not be hurting you.
"I need to see you in your shorts whenever you come downstairs at night to read by the fire, I need to see your bra through the innocent white tank tops that you wear trying to hide your figure."

Hermione asked not catching on.
Hermione ended up reading herself asleep by the time that the Head Boy entered the compartment.
