Hermione could not stop grinning as they made their way up to a nicely decorated and furnished box area.
What was she supposed to do?
Why aren't you with the others?"
She was still worried for Harry, of course, but she was more focused on how she would soften the blow of Fleur's defeat for her.
There was still more work to be done, and until Hermione herself woke up, there was nothing else Fleur could do except get as much information as she could from the others to help them in their mission.
She knew that once they were properly alone, it would take every modicum of will power not to fall back into old habits, and that kind of distraction was something she could not allow, especially now of all times.
Truth be told, Fleur had barely thought about the third task or the tournament.
Our newest member of the Beast Division.
Unable to even begin to take in the extravagance inside, she was focused solely on what was about to happen.
It took about a year after completing her N. E.W.
Absolutely not, but here they were.
Thinking back to her desire to help house elves, and really any and all magical creatures that were seen as lesser, Hermione started looking within the Ministry of Magic.
Hermione smiled and her eyes cleared up.
Her sharp voice commanded attention as she spoke.
This is Hermione Granger.
Knees constantly touching as they sat together on the log near the boat house, faces so close they could feel each other's breath faintly on their skin.
There were so many other Beauxbatons students she felt were more qualified, she already felt in over her head.
One of Hermione's hands moved up to brush the tears away.
The night before the task, Harry let Hermione borrow the cloak and Hermione spent the night with Fleur.
This time was far, far different.
