o0o Severus and Lily finished their tea together in a silence that carried many unspoken words.
What on Earth could have made her so depressed?
Wearily, Severus conceded, sending a cup of tea over to her followed by a small jug of milk.
"Well, it's a long story and one I have promised to tell you all about another time, but I was actually home-schooled.
"And how are you still here?"
She smirked as she rounded down another flight of stairs with Severus still bristling after her.
Delphi was once more sitting crossed-legged on the floor of Spinner's End, picking out deliciously fatty wedges of potato from an expanse of grease-stained white paper and devouring them with relish.
To say it was somewhat of an anticlimax was an understatement.
"I think so," Severus replied slowly.
Dumbledore had the good grace to remove the vile thing when he became Headmaster but by then it was too late, You-Know-Who had already created his first Horcrux when he'd been at school."
The young woman clearly had more depth than he gave her credit for.
Those keen dark eyes with long, thick eyelashes and perfect pale skin, and the little purse of her lips when something amused her; all signs of her Black heritage, yet in terms of personality she couldn't be more different to her mother.
The only thing is, I'm a human receptacle rather than an object, and the time belongs to my father.
It was enough to drive a man mad!
"I'll get the Essence of Dittany, you dry yourselves off," Lily said matter-of-factly.
"Come on," Delphi said gently, touching his arm as if reading his thoughts.
Delphi's breath caught in her throat.
He could taste the sweet wine on her silky lips, the warmth of them sending volts of desire through him.
Delphi called as Severus strode into the hall.
She carefully wrapped the long thin chain of the Golden Time-Turner around them both and then looked up at Severus, her dark eyes shining in the dim light.
