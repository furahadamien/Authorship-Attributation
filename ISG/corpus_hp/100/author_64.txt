Harry clicked his tongue, "Shoot."
When the bell signalled lunch time, the teacher made his way over to the window, stating he was going to go to China for some mapo tofu.
The whole class gave off an air of gloom and depression.
A woman came into their class one day with Koro-sensei and Karasuma.
"Now that's…straight foreword."
Right after lunch, Koro-sensei would gain an interesting expression.
"Ah, that's the infamous Koro-sensei?"
But four is more than enough to start it off, right?
"Karasuma-sensei, is there really any point to all this training?"
The teacher said when it was all over, "Not a single bullet hit it's mark today either."
Karasuma said, silencing the doubtful murmurs, "I trust there are no complaints about her taking over part of your English classes."
He started falling backwards off the cliff, "For sure."
"What was that stick thing you used?"
"I'm Karasuma from the Ministry of Defense.
Karasuma asked from the doorway.
In the mornings, the teacher would take attendance, and they would start firing their guns all at once during this time in hopes of one of the bullets hitting.
"Trying our best won't do much."
But…maybe in the future, if it became necessary when he got back to his own world…The fact was, this was all training for when he returned home.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Figures."
Even though it seemed like it might have been a joke, he could tell that she was completely serious.
