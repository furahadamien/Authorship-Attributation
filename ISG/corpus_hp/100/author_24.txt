I remembered from my reading that the hat traditionally sang a song before the Sorting, so I waited expectantly.
We walked in the direction she had indicated and soon came to a shop called Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, which was obviously where the older lady had intended us to go.
We pulled into the parking lot outside of King's Cross Station and climbed out of the car.
We went to a shop called Ollivanders.
Mum asked me, realizing she hadn't checked before we left the house.
Ron had been very patronizing, but then again, I had just inserted myself into the conversation.
Not knowing that they despised me.
I tried to cheer Neville up by telling him he would do great, but I don't think I did a very good job.
I'm quite looking forward to writing the exams, though I still have a while to go before we get to that.
It's fascinating to see the comparisons between muggle and wizarding history.
Ron turned and gave me a haughty look.
I certainly didn't want Ron to do any of my homework.
Sally-Anne groaned, making me feel small and insignificant.
I pulled out my supply list and decided to be smart about things and go in order, so as not to miss anything.
"Your other classmates are all starting to form solid friendships, and I would hate for you to be left out of that because you waited too long to integrate yourself."
Then Ron released the spell, letting the club fall straight down, knocking the troll unconscious.
I'd just been trying to make small talk.
Looks to me more like you just do your homework next to each other.
She'd warmed up to me quite a bit, and I enjoyed chatting with her about the various books I was reading.
The hat noticed my sudden rush of pride and it made a note that pride was certainly a Gryffindor quality.
