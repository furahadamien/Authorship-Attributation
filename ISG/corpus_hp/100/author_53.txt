"Ooh, good one," Fred complimented him.
"Okay, we need to talk about this," Fred said.
"Well, it's a start," Sirius said.
"I do some years, but sadly nobody was interested in the noble art of Alchemy this year," Dumbledore told him.
Remus paused, then gave a solemn nod.
What about people who were Squibs, who didn't have any magic but came from a magical family?
"I said to shush," Fred agreed.
As it was, he knew it was coming, and he knew roughly when, but he had no idea how many people had names that were ahead of him in the alphabet so every new name just ratcheted up the tension.
Would it mean he'd levitate something a little bit and then pull it along with him as he flew at high speed?
Neville asked, turning to look at Hermione.
"My apologies," Dumbledore replied.
"Perhaps I shall have to ask Hagrid some time."
Harry did, so he set off, and Sirius came with him so they could talk.
"I don't see why you're so upset," Great Uncle Algie retorted.
"I'll be happy just so long as they actually know how to cast spells," Percy volunteered.
Harry lit his wand with a Lumos spell and held it overhead in his tail, giving them all a little extra light.
"I think this one's egg," he said.
"How many classes are there?"
It took you several seconds to spot the first one, but after that you barely waited long enough to hear which one I wanted."
Harry was grateful to the twins for helping the new students understand him a little bit better, without even sounding like they were doing it, and as he was wondering how (or if) he should thank them there was a gentle cough from behind him.
