The time is now on an evening very much like the one we have just witnessed.
Bloodspraying is almost done, now I have to add metal meshing and other things to the other walls.
Anyways, yah so you will have pictures this week, and sorry that I didn't update the random picture of the week, I've been having trouble getting onto my site lately....Gotta love AOL.....God damnit I hate AOL.
Anyways I'm hungry as hell right now.
My scooter was pre-assembled by retards and does not work.
I will then rip out my heart, and eat it.
I'm still kinda sore from it.
Please watch your step as you board.
Over The Shoulder Restraints (OTSRs) on Kingdom of the Dinosaurs:  Safety is everything here, who knows when someone could be dragged under the amazingly fast 1/2 mph moving vehicles.
It needs to die, and fast.
And people who IM me continously, please stop.
I was stuck with an entire soccer team of really immature girls who do stupid things.
Recently, Fry's started selling DDR stuff, including DDR pads.
And I guess this year they're doing like...ERT on the Log Ride and the Mine Ride....wow...I can see that now...4000 lb boats running at like 2 mph breaking the flume and shooting water everywhere.
I tried this thing out, and found out it sucked  royally .
I was talking to my much awsome friend, but she went to go work on her site.
Happy Thanksgiving everyone.
My most recent bitching goes as follows.
I've had to put up with stupid people for awhile now.
After that I just...roamed really.
