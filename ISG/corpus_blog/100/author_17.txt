Surgery will be followed by more chemo.
I trust that wasn't you, Natalie.
It's Very strange really.
Sherry- Ooh, yeah, I saw Jeff G on there a couple of times today- and you're right- he's the first in a couple of days.
I guess that we'll just have to wait and see about that.
Teri - Thanks for the congrats on my weight loss.
Rick was just on reporting from Israel on an Iraqi baby being treated by Israeli doctors for an unusual heart condition.
I think it'll be an early night for me tonight!
I'm leaning towards the bulk mailing thing....it's hard to say how they mail all that stuff out.
What goes on in your office, Natalie, sounds almost like a sitcom, except that I'm sure that it isn't funny to you.
Melissa- I'm *so* glad you heard from Jen & that she's doing fine.
It was really weird- it came on suddenly and then was gone in a couple of minutes (for the clamminess).
Sad that things have to be that way, but I think that's the way a lot of voters vote.
Maybe it's just the weather.
Talk to my stepdad who is in Annandale VA and they lost their power a couple ours ago.
He covered the sniper story here in Maryland so I saw a lot of him during that time.
Nat - my dad used to pronouce INXS as "inks".
- EAJ Janice L - you could be right here... maybe asking some of those questions in our dreams is okay (maybe), but (now I just have to put on my former "teacher hat" here - sorry)...
Kerry is the biggest flip flop ass that ever was.
Jan- Sorry you missed your game due to the heat, but happy to see your post!
