Becasue i was still stuck @ my practical 4... when i'm suppose to be doin the next practical.
Hmmm, i can't even hear what my lecturer is talking about, he seems to be talking to himself... kekeke.
We went to ICT Club to borrow a ball, but rather dissappointed by the lock-up of the room.

Anyway, with every sucessfull completion of my java practicals, i think i'm startin to love it.
Find that he's really good in his java,&nbsp; his explanation are always esy to understand... kekeke.
Ended up late in class....
*LOL* Come to think about it, feel that it's kind of lame, isn't it?

I seems to lost my touch in my Java programming, envy Kang Heong's skills in it.
Hmmm, all thanks to my friend Kang Heong.
first thing in the morning i've spent more than 15 mins waiting for my bus.
I thought he was gonna blow up again like what he did few weeks back, lucky i was wrong.
I was exhausted then, after being fooled (according to darran) by them.
I guess i describe him till like his a bad guy huh?
Hmmm, i think i wanna wait for til next week, hope that they'll come out with some promotions.
In fact,  i respect them alot, for their knowledge and they as our lecturer.
So guys, which one is better;              Styke           Stike           Staik          Hmmm, guess i seriously need some advises from people.
Nope, he ain't a bad guy.
I mean, hmmm, shouldn't it be open for school hours?
