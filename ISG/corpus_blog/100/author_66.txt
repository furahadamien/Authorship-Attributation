WHAT THE FUCK lost 4 people outta the homecoming group.
Learning that I'm worth much more than Geoff ever let me think, and being thankful that I had people to tell me that.
It will make it hard to get over me, for the fact that Ravelle and I are friends.
and them like 8 people i know ate my store all at the same time, interesting.
"No," said Mitchell, "I like your face, I like you I like you I like you."
i mean, a lot of things are really unclear for me right now."
Converstions late at night, ice cream on summer nights, certain voices, daisies, hugs, friendship, forehead & cheek kisses.
I know that he’s a strong person, but only so much can happen before someone breakdown.
and then get frustrated that you and i dont talk enough.
the whole "IM NOT TALKING LIKE AN ASSHOLE WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?"
and we got 10th outta 15th.
it's gone, and it feels empty and you hate it.
And I was told that he slept with someone a week and a day after we broke up....apparently....he didn't which was told to me like a month ago.....but where's the trust now.
I'd gather them into one giant room.
The way they spin and turn and jockey for positions.
meep  oh brittany sprears is a skank.
one more day of junior year....and i think i should write about it.
"What's the difference," said Margo, "I want you to stay next door forever.
fyi, you were at someone's house all fucking day, is there a reason you couldn't have called me to let me know we were NOT hanging out?
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?
