They create a wide variety of stupid situations ,you think you had passed through this situations before.
On friday,as usual,I was browsing the web for study materials(this is what I do to  kill time).I got a call from my company,that ,a company called IBP 19 KM from Gurgaon,Haryana has a problem where a user cannot open his Outlook Express.
There is only perosn who knows about this ,my colleague Ajay.
When I called him he started to get aggressive saying that I should have come earlier.
The interview was on Monday.
I was very much confident on JAVA ,because this was very much my domain.
I have to go to CMS tommorrow.
I said ,I had to take the real step.
Mother says it is dad who is worried about my health.
The new tecnology has made my life difficult .He asked me whether the problem is to be locked  by me or by CMS computers.
They just eat ,drink and sleep.
The very next at 10.00Am ,my brother-in-law's office mate helped me with all the doctor and stuff.
The whole week went from 17/05/04(Monday) went on very well.
He asked me to come on saturday.
Well,my mistake began when,I got a mail from the region office to update Windows2000 patches,he also wanted me to do it before quitting.
The lousy girl ,Monica,gave me two addresses to which I had to attend to.
This is no big deal .Anybody ,who has a decent knowledge of computer settings can do it.
When I got out ,it was very dark with a glimmer of light a few distance away.
I contacted the HR guy after 2 days .He told me the rejection of my candidature rather beautifully.
I am pretty much accustomed to that protocol.
