Tuesday we were at Turner Field and had a blast watching the Braves beat the Royals 3 to 2.
5$ seats were AWESOME!TTFN
I think I got it all dried up.
I got my fingers crossed.
My first day on the Blog Report.
Anywho, it's hotter'n heck here in Atlanta today but I've seen worse, so no complaints from me.
My daughter Haley is here to spend the summer and we are really enjoying the time together.
We'll see what happens.... Ok, so cool groups of the week are:  A Perfect Circle  Maroon 5 (Harder to Breath is spankdilyicious!)
All is seemingly quiet here.
Needless to say I was pissed, but whaddya gonna do?
We saw the new Harry Potter movie today and it was pretty good.
May take Haley to the Atlanta Zoo this weekend and checkout some of the cool animals.
Lots of my friends losing their jobs today.
She's in daycamp at the YMCA and having fun.
I'll jot more down lata..... Ok. Made it through the cuts and still kicking at work.
My interior was completely friggin' SOAKED!
Things getting busy here at work but BUSY is good.
Of course my car was in the driveway with the sunroof open.
And the next owner will never know, so no worries!
Ok, gotta get back to work.
