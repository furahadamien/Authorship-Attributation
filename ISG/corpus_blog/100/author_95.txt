The Wife started speaking to me again, I went to my mom's house for July 4th, and there were several household chores that had backed up a bit.
He is more of a hack-and-slash type, whereas Gladius is a much more tactical game.
Also, I would like to get something that I can play in an "interrupted" fashion.
I picked up Armed and Dangerous again last night, went through the first bit again.&nbsp; It is rather lackluster, but potentially fun - I will have to go a bit further.
I picked up RalliSport Challenge 2 last night and ran the first race on the "Amateur" level.
I did play for a few hours, though, off and on.
The others don't thrill me too much, but I haven't tried all of them yet.
That is not a fair characterization.
She tried to pick up PGR2 again, but she had lost her touch.
I have quite a bit to catch up on.
As an added bonus, her best partner is Lei Fang, who is very cute.
We may have to form a clan soon.
I started again on Morrowind as well.&nbsp; I've just been playing various games lately, hopping around.&nbsp; When I was playing Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR), I pretty much just stuck with it until I was finished.
And I don't want to have to upgrade my PC.
I ask her to partner, but she is not interested.
The new cars:  Some OK, some excellent.
First of all, I want a game that I will  play .
We packed up everything and I snuck the XBox into the back of the van, telling my wife that I had brought it after we were an hour down the road.
Did not get a chance to play tonight, but I did see a trailer for Brothers in Arms on  urlLink GameTrailers.
It's a pretty tough one, and I didn't get as far on it as I did when I played on Saturday.&nbsp; I am definately a more cautious player than Ed, who also played on Saturday.
