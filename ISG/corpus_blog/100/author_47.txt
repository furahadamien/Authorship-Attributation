we go down and they're there and all and we all go in and it took like forever for everyone to get some balls but we got in, then we had to decide who wanted to walk through the water and it wound up being me, chris, sal, cliff, jackie and mario (leading the way lol because apparently he has to go first since we don't care if he dies lmao) and we're walking and we start hearing shit.
