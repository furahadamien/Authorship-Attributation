So the car is at the dealership.
I'm wondering if there might be a problem with the rear differential.. the car doesn't seem to be going as fast as the speedometer indicates.
As we were walking out, my 6-year-old boy (who just had  his  b-day too) says to me "Can we come back again tomorrow?"
Mom stuff with ma boy like I did in October.
Nice to see old co-workers, like Dave Jemmott and Fernando Chilvarguer.
Slept about 3 hours last night.
Nathan started swimming without his water wings (!)
stop start login test edit.
Friday night, as we were swimming at the lodge it started hailing, while the sun was shining.
We'll be staying at a timeshare in King's Beach (north shore).
Nathan was bored as hell of course.
It's also the first day of my web log.
I'm not much of a blogger, apparently.
I'm not sure what I'm going to put here yet, or how often I'll update.
A couple of people have actually looked at my weblog recently, and I hadn't updated it in almost a year.
Must watch that, tut tut.
After 30, I didn't care so much about bdays anymore.
Got LoJack installed, interior upholstery treatment, and fixed a problem with interior lights not working (map light, vanity mirror lights).
I scheduled a plumber to come by, had a whole mess of work for them to do, like installing a new kitchen sink/faucet/disposal/water purifier, back patio faucet blah blah blah  So I leave work early, wait for 2 hours yesterday afternoon.
Hopefully I don't drive off a cliff on my way up there.
