I really enjoy being with the guys and learning the protocols of opening and closing the lodge is very interesting.
Lori, though, is quite supportive so it doesn't look like it is going to be any hardship.
There's got to be a label for this kind of behavior, but the name escapes me.
Note to self... Don't wear rubber-soled shoes on meeting nights.
urlLink Rebeccas Pocket  looks like a really good one.
I've also been spending my lunches with Larry at the Game Keeper.
I guess the most important thing that I've learned from working on a job like this is to always keep an even keel, even when the client is flipping out, and also to keep the ol' ego in check; realizing that I don't know everything about computers and that each day is a learning experience.
I decided to start this blog up again.
Hopefully this will slow things down a bit and allow me to look back and say "Wow, I guess I really did do something last week!"
Well I guess Im enjoying reading about what other people are doing and I'm finding that I dont spend nearly enough time reflecting about what Im doing / or have done.
Honestly, I didn't really know what each office did, but I'm finding out that the Senior Steward, among other things, takes care of the kitchen and the meals for the lodge.
I'm toying with the idea of setting up 2 blogs.
Luckily the day is almost over so I'm kind of coasting into the weekend.
It's usually always quite interesting visiting him and seeing the folks that wondering into the store.
I'm going to call Lori to see if we can scrape up enough so we can get it for the weekend.
Basically I drive from one place to the next fixing computer hardware, software, and network problems for doctors.
I'd really like to get it, but we're a bit short on funds at the moment.
Funny thing with all of this is that I was asked to be Senior Steward, instead of Junior Steward.
Work has had me zooming between Providence, RI and Newport three times so far.
It's been quite a busy couple of days.
