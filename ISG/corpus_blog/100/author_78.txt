each time it would rewind and people would go backwards and the scene would start again.
then it gets even weirder.
i don't know who, but i knew him.
thank god tlb for ur phone call.
i did, and all of a sudden, he was in front of me.
they were the butch kind.
telling me scary stories.
i had a feelign i had my eyes open but everything was blurry.
then i think i had to pick up TLB.
all of a sudden, i see stalker w/ a gun and he's trying to go after me.
then me TLB and princess were hanging out in his room.
i kept staring at the towel and the hidden face beneath.
he had a towel over his head (like when athletes sweat and they put a towel on their head and the sides hang down).
so i had to grab the rug from the floor and use it as a towel to cover my nakedness.
oh yeah, there was a part that i was taking a shower and i was naked and there was some sort of YFC or SFC praise event that my aunt was throwing and they were letting people in.
and he gets mad that there's another guy there and they start arguing.
i think i may have been a tiny bit jealous, but we were good friends so i got over it.
then i don't remember what happened next.
then stalker changed it again.
stalker (who is now himself) comes in.
