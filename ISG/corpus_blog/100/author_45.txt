:)  Karissa-glad to hear that you had a good birthday weekend.
Then again, if I ever have another cavity in my teeth, I'm going to be screaming for a reverse epidural (no, this doesn't really exist because most people think it's a bad thing to be paralyzed from the neck up), but that's just because I hate having dental work done.
Sure I missed the sunshine, but it was still delightful to wake up, roll over, and go back to sleep a couple of times.
They also have a free 40,000 item catalog.

Ok, so Em has a baldder infection, Cara has an eye ulcer, I'm going through a depressive fit (my left lower eyelid keeps twitching and my left shoulder is really tight), we all have IBS...
;)  Steph: Thanks for the heads up on the bill paying thing.
Just a thought Karissa, The only thing I know about condos is that they are harder to resell.

:)  Cara: I like the name Marla, too.
I won a gorilla from the claw-grabber game at the laundrymat.
you sound excited about it.
Karissa- if you'd like to come up, we'd love to have you...  Steph, I don't think you'd get here in time .. .
Shouldn't they have staff to come in and do that?
We took my viola around Indy to have it appraised and hopefully we'll get a good offer for it.
I wouldn't have even caught that shower reference- thanks for the disclaimer for those of us Obvious-impaired.
John brought Sosa over to visit.
You know, I'd think about becoming a drug addict but I don't have the time or the money.
