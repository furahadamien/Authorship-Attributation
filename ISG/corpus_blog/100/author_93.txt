Thoughts that turn to emotion, Of love, lost and not yet found, Of loneliness, of hurt, of guilt, Emotions that turn and boil within me, Boil and turn until they change, Change into tears, Tears which run my face.

All alone again,  Another day, another night, Alone.
I grow hot with anger, My fist clenched tightly,  Knuckles white, Tears flowing from my eyes,  Why, I do not know, With all my anger I strike at my hatred, Stomping and kicking, Shattering the face, Breaking the mirror, Sending me spiraling downward, Into a black pool of depression, For I have been imprisioned by my enemy, Trapped by myself, Broken by my own body, Hated by my own mind, Damned by my insecurities.
Everything good in me, is you.
All alone, as I've learned to be.
I looked for love, But love could not be found, Cause love is you.
