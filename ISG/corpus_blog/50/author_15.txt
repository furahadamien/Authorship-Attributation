Well, unlike "cheena" twits who surround us day after day, breathing our precious air and contaminating innocent ears with their infantile acronyms whose linguistic capabilities barely exceed two syllable words, we normal people understand words beyond the kindergarten level and are able to SPEAK right and TYPE legibly, as opposed to "LyK DiS".
