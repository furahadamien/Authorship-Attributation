When I need to say �yes���ten-four� comes out instead.
I have, however, had my share of ups and downs and I feel that I have earned enough credibility and respect to have my own idea and opinion about certain things.
It was a good turn out, we sold out all 4 shows.
So, with this said, I will return to work and continue towards getting my license again.
I am moving to be close to my honey Brenden.
So plans now are to enjoy this next week I will still not be working, doing a lot of sleeping, and trying to find some way to spend my 4th of July.
I think I am going to make dinner and we are going to watch a video here at my place.
I shared my feelings with him.
God bless  urlLink Chris!
I hope that all can get a chance to come and see it.
I have no license or transportation yet either, we will see how that works out.
Brenden left today for a week in San Jose.
All three of these things are new to me.
I can already tell that he is the type that will be willing to help and work around being so far apart.
With Brenden's car still out of the picture, we worked the bus, train and taxi system to death over the two days I was there.
It is almost 2am and I think I will actually be heading off to bed.
In the beginning I was looking for it, searching for it�was doing nothing but making myself depressed.
I know that itself was more than I was writing on this thing anyway�but now I have an excuse.
The last time I wrote an entry, well�.needless to say is was a couple weeks ago.
That makes me sad...saying that...and it's not like I have experienced anything else...it's just a feeling...you know...one of those nausiated, sick, faint kind of feelings.
I had one of those seconds in my head that last forever: I imagined rolling all the way down the staircase and either becoming dead or having to be rushed to the hospital.
Otherwise things are going good.
Yes, this was the second time it has happened, the first time being about two years ago.
A few friends have asked to be updated on the accident and the resulting wave of whatever it has created.
I am okay now with going with the flow and letting the �click� find me.
This is the first comment I have received from anyone other than friends of mine.
It is an ensemble role, but just a step above chorus.
If it makes you feel any better, I will be giving myself restrictions on when and under what conditions I drive.
Let me tell you how excited I am.
He wouldn�t tell me what it is, and the only hint I could get out of him was that it was �gold� in color.
I get to check my email, chat with buddies, and update this blog once a week if I am lucky.
I have contacted the DMV and they are sending a letter for me and my doctor to fill out.
The answer took a while...But the solution is simple, I need my license back.
I am not paying for cable, so I have lots of time and silence to contemplate the previous two points.
And I have also made a couple bad choices�but I think I am a better person for it, I know better now, that�s for sure�and all this within the last month.
Most sociable of all types.
I love her too...But I would be more apt to show my love if I was able to be a independent 23 year old...In the complete sense of the word that is.
As of late, more and more friends have been starting one of these "blog" things.
The so called Gentleman was going to be home that Friday, and he wanted his house clear and empty by the time he got there.
So let�s see�what�s going on?
They have a stipulation�they do not want to hire drug-ee�s�so I took my drug test this afternoon and should be to work sometime next week.
I made a statement at a party, the first time I met Melissa in fact, that offended her.
First things first�I was approved for my own apartment!
It pays less, but it will come with benefits and perks, as well as an opportunity to work with men in the construction business�a good thing on so many levels.
I really need to drive :(  Work...is slowly getting better.
I ran downstairs and told my roommate to let my mom in, then ran back upstairs to jump in the shower.
Rob came up again on Saturday.
What you know is what you know.
urlLink Brenden  is wonderful as usual.
I can see myself saying many of her lyrics to the men in my life.
I, being without a license or a vehicle, would have trouble getting to work on a daily basis.
United is located in Lancaster, much closer than the Base.
With the leaving of the training job, stage managing children�s theatre, and being cast in an adult drama production that will immediately follow�I have a bit to think about.
I wanted nothing else than to make a good impression.
I am getting out of debt.
He is having fun with the kids he is volunteering for.
I hope it was worth it, and on a personal note, I really hope my 24th birthday will be better than my 23rd.
The show is going really well.
His wife  urlLink Jenna  was expecting baby Westley in June, but he has also decided to come a bit early.
That�s all for now kids.
There I have been for about 4 weeks and I am praying that the applications I have put out for an apartment will go through.
Tomorrow is my last day of work at United and I couldn't be more happy.
It is becoming habit and I don�t think I like it.
Speaking of babies�there is another one on the way.
I got into a car accident Wednesday morning on the way to work.
I can�t seem to nail anything down.
All through my wild days, my mad existence...
So I am leaving it at that.
More research is needed on the subject.
I, of course, will let you know what comes of it.
I am on yet another adventure into a different shade of red.
It is (was) a wonderful series...For all those other sci-fi freaks such as myself.
This was all before this last weekend.
I want to work on this�this�problem.
You know who you are�obviously�because you are reading this.
Don�t get me wrong, I am having a ball having fun.
I am pretty sure I still hold the title of "Straightest Girl in America."
That gives me another week and one more payday.
I am finding out that here in the Antelope Valley that it is not possible.
The check can take up to 5 days, so we will see.
True to form, I of course wanted to join the bandwagon.
I am failing�I feel�miserably at that.
Reality is at times a hard pill to swallow, but I kind of see how it is at the moment.
I thought about Chad as well.
And there is a song about crashing cars...Why I relate to that I have no idea.
I will be working customer service in the billing department of the company.
Sorry, bad show tune reference.
The interview went well, I was called the day after and they said they felt it went really well too.
Thank you to all that have signed my guestbook, and please feel free to sign again if the fancy strikes you!
I have not written in a while.
He will probably be admitted to the hospital until the problem is resolved.
The way things worked out, he didn't end up getting into Palmdale till 2:35 and we rushed to the theatre just in time to see the massive line that had formed outside working its way into the theatre.
If you were one to ride within its prestigous walls, please join me in a moment of silence for this fallen soilder.
Parents are encouraged to bring their children dressed as Princes and Princesses to watch us and participate in a parade around the store.
It is centered on the story of a woman who cheats on and kills her husband (fun, fun, fun).
I had taken a test and faxed it to them earlier in the week, and I guess I did really well on it.
I did not get to sleep last night till after 6am.
The great thing about Chris is�well�that he is Chris.
I am healthy, alive, and capable...Must focus on things to be thankful for.
I came to realize no matter what our relationship was before, that we can have a strong friendship now and in the future.
