And maybe I will marry William Collins, I mused fiercely.
Who was the very person that I was indeed sent to retrieve.
Yet, my eyes changed course as another window opened and a familiar beaming face appeared, alongside her pretty voice.
You are not worthy of being Alpha Darcy's luna, Miss Bennet, not worthy of true Werewolf society.
The most sought after male in all of our high school, no less.
I dared to raise my eyes to the sound of his voice, which was, of course, a mistake for which a sorely cursed myself.
Bingley would of course suit, my mind assessed, the role of Deputy Head Boy, and Miss Caroline Bingley would claw her way to the top of the school social ladder.
After all, he is your mate."
"Unhand my sister, you creepy little K9!"
Perhaps, I could dance with her tomorrow!"
Your own family of Loungbourn are just as dysfunctional, Miss.
Of course, if I were going by those standards then it did not seem hard for my brain to imagine Alpha Darcy as the Head Boy at our school.
Mr. Collins, shocked at the bellowing, rude and loud voice calling from one of the highest windows in Netherfield enabled him to lose my hand, which he turned into an eager wave to the man that seemed to be the very bane of my existence.
I will make him regret such a commandment, my mind drooled.
A flash of rememberance crossed across my brain as her hand settled upon my clothed shoulder, where her teeth had once been, dragging me through the forest and mud.
I cried until everything went dark...
Sweat covered my brow most ungracefully but I cared little when a fire burned within me at the sound that shot through my own ears.
In an odd sort of way, he appeared to possess a peculiar sense of attractiveness.
Daring to lay a hand upon Alpha Darcy, as if you're entitled!
Her daughters rise in the world of werewolves!
