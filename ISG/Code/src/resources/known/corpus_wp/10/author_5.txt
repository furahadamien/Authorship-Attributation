""The one from the government or someone?""Yeah.
""Took them all up in a big beam of light right in the woods.
""You become one of them.
"Away from here" Mark said.
"Did it happen here too?The moon?
"He's dying!He's not gonna attack us.
"I pushed down on the accelerator and we drove out the garage.
"I said, turning the volume all the way down.
"I went to my room and grabbed my umbrella and put on a hoodie.
"Isn't she beautiful tonight!?
"Look " said Mark, starting the video.
"Mark said, as he got in the car.
"Mark said, putting his umbrella down.
"She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
"The man looked at me "The moon took them away" he whispered."What?
"This is me, the same me I've always been.
"What if he's one of them?
"he said as shards of glass fell on his lap.
**3:00 AM**  *bzzz*  I groaned awake as my vibrating phone buzzed on the bedside table.
A broken mirror lay on the floor.
Any feedback or criticism will be appreciated.
As I got up I heard Mark scream.
Did someone break in?Did Jason fight him?It certainly looked like a fight had happened.
Everyone who'd looked at it".I couldn't say a word.
He lost his grip and fell off as I drove off.
He put his phone in, but kept the back camera on.
He rolled over with Mark on the ground.
He was holding an umbrella and his face was covered in sweat.
He was screaming and growling.
He'd received the same warning as me, only a bit later.
He'd sent the same message to all his contacts and other random numbers.
I backed towards the car.
I climbed in the driver's seat.
I didn't know any of these numbers.
I dozed off...  **3:13 AM**      *bzzz*     *bzzz*     *bzzbzzbzzzZZZ*      I woke up with a start.
I fell down on the floor.
I filled my car and drove back home.-- This is my first writing prompt response.
I got in the car and shut the door as the man charged on my side, banging on the window as I turned on the ignition.
I guess"     "Is that what happened to Jason?""Yes.
I looked at his sent messages.
I looked at the lock screen.>78 New Messages   The phone buzzed again.>79 New Messages   >83 New Messages   I swiped the screen and scrolled through the messages.
I looked to him and saw him, staring at the moon, his iris turning from brown to pale gray.
I looked up and saw my other roommate, Mark.
I picked it up and scrolled through his messages.
I pushed down on the accelerator, speeding up when a someone jumped in front of our car and we crashed into him.
I put my foot down on the accelerator and drove as fast as I could.
I reached out from under the sheets and looked at the notification.
I reached out to my phone and turned the screen on again.
I scrolled until I came across a familiar contact.>JASON L.       My roommate, the stupid one.
I stepped towards the window to take a look when someone pulled me back by the shoulder.
I swerved the car and punched him in the face.
I wanna know what the whole moon thing is about.
In front of us, an old man lay on the road, he was bleeding, but still breathing.
In the rear view mirror I saw a massive crowd of people running towards us from behind our house.
It was a loud screech of at least fifty people screaming.
It was a text message.>OFFICIAL WARNING: Do not look at the moon.
It was unlike anything I could've imagined, the moon was huge.
It's been a week since it happened.
It's like some kind of mind control.
It's probably a prank or something.
Jason was nowhere to be found.
Looking up the street I didn't see anyone coming.
Mark charged on the passenger side and tried to force himself into the car.
Mark was waiting near the door.
My hands starting to shake, I turned the ignition on.
My music system began blaring.
Nodding, I turned us towards the national highway, speeding faster.
Nothing I need to lose sleep about, I got college tomorrow anyway.
The crowd continued chasing us and getting smaller in the mirror until they stopped and turned back.
The lamp was knocked on the floor.
The man joined him, and they both charged towards me.
The man kicked out and tripped me.
The town was empty save for a few people.
The windows were open and white moonlight was spilling through the gap in the curtains onto his floor.
There were a few cars on the road.
There were also many messages similar to mine telling him to look outside.
There were books, and papers lying everywhere.
They were standing on the street looking into houses.
We stepped outside and opened our umbrellas.
We stopped and walked out under Mark's Umbrella.
We walked to the window and he started a video recording.
What the actual fuck is going on, Mark?
What's with this moon thing tonight?I got up and walked to his room.
Who needs a warning at 3 AM to not look at the moon on a new moon night?Astronomers and space geeks probably.
Why'd he text me when he could've just woken me up?I clicked on the message.>Come outside!The moon is so beautiful tonight!I looked at the other messages, they were similar.
You can't be too careful.
