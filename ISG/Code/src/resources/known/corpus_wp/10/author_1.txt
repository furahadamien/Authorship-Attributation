""Sir, with all due respect, this isn't the first person who's made this accusation.
"*   James Hook hid himself in the shadows, careful not to let himself show.
"A frisson of fear ran down her spine.
"And I know you gave her that serum you concocted," he hissed.
"Best fiance ever," she corrected, and tilted his face so they could look at the moon together.
"Curtis Walsh, the captain of the precinct, clasped his hands together and sat back in his chair.
"DO NOT LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.
"Half my minions are still on holiday because of the overtime.
"He brought up his hand and blew dust into Hook's face, blinding him temporarily.
"He gritted his teeth and walked around the metal table until he was standing right in front of her.
"He paced around the table.
"Hey," the boy said with an innocent smile.
"I forgave that you drank the damn thing yourself.
"I told them not to send the messages, but it was too late when I noticed the typo--I'm going to kill Erin by the way--and everyone has such quick reflexes-"   Linda simply laughed and cut him off, throwing herself into his arms.
"It's a beautiful night tonight.
"Not sure what you're talking about.
"Sir, please--"   "I mean it, Hook, drop the case.
"Yeah, it would be quite an accomplishment," he said, his jaw clenching, 'if she weren't supposed to die two months ago.
"You know very well what I'm here for.
"You really expect the police to send resources over to investigate this kind of...madcap accusation made by a homeless person?
"You're threatening the mother of your future child?
"You've got something of mine it seems.
"he yelled, then followed her out like a puppy dog chasing after its owner.
######[](#dropcap)  It was one of those surreal moments that you only get to experience once in life.
*****   r/AlannaWu ########## ######[](#dropcap)  The man swirled into Kassidy's lab, his black cape flowing behind him.
After a minute, the messages slowed down.
After what felt like years, the window finally opened again, and Peter climbed down, the sound of his whistling shrill in Hook's ears.
All he knew was that Pan was a wily one, and there were claims of him scaling the emergency ladders to get up into children's bedrooms without the parents knowing.
As much joy as he was capable of feeling, anyhow.
Because I'm sure you guys clearly deserve it.
But she couldn't ignore him entirely, she supposed.
But these missing children deserved a future, and he was going to give it to them, left hand or not.
Did you know the horror that caused?Gunshot wounds in stasis, people who should have bled out, dear lord, the number of newspapers I had to forcefully recall.
He couldn't even be mad at her now.
He glanced down at her, then ducked into the basket.
He had no way of knowing whether Carly's tipoff would be accurate or not--that was really the risk that you took when trusting a homeless person for a source--but he had to give it a shot.
He moved closer, edging behind a car on the street.
He snapped a couple more pictures.
He threw a temper tantrum for three days straight, trained Cerberus to basically revolt against me, and then quit his job for a whole week.
He turned his head to face a boy with blonde hair and beautiful, elegant features in a green hoodie.
He was probably too far for them to have noticed.
He watched as the figure jumped and brought down the emergency ladder and clambered up.
He would get revenge on Erin tomorrow, he vowed, his face dark.
He'd forgotten to turn off flash.
He'd never found who did it.
His claws sheathed themselves, and he touched Kassidy's arm, turning her around.
Hook sat in silence, equally patient, his camera at the ready.
How many people have you given the serum to?
I'm really sorry for you, and I tried to find the culprit.
If things turned out badly, he might even be stripped of his title.
It looked like she wasn't about to get any more work done today.
It was his only clue right now to where Pan might show up next.216 Never Way Apt #207.He looked at the address once more before crinkling the slip of paper in his pocket.
It's a full moon tonight.
Living until you're 120 years old is quite a feat.
Lucifer narrowed his kohl-rimmed eyes at her.
Mother of his...his eyes widened and flashed with something akin to joy.
On the screen, along with a picture of the elderly women, was the age at which she was supposed to die.
Perhaps a killer clown or a ghost.
She scrolled through, just to make sure she wasn't missing something.
She simply stood there, waiting for him to get down.
She'd been such a good girl.
Slowly at first, just a couple messages.
Slowly, she reached out a hand and flicked off the lamp on her desk so that her room became pitch dark.
So with hesitant steps, she walked toward the dark curtain that was covering her window.
So you can head back to Hell now.
That's not our department.
The last time Lucifer had paid her a visit, he'd stayed for three days and three nights.
The liquid evaporated almost immediately upon contact with the air.
The other gods, who had slumbered since thousands of years ago, would finally awaken, and he would be put on trial for mishandling things.
Then Hook felt the world fade to black.
Then he pulled out his phone.
There had to be one good one in there.
This had to be some kind of joke.
We don't need some silly fairy tale explanation to make ourselves feel better about why it's true.
With a frown, she glanced at the messages that were popping up quickly, one after another.
Work friends, she thought.
You don't know how *angry* Fred was with me when I told him he couldn't take your soul and had to explain why.
