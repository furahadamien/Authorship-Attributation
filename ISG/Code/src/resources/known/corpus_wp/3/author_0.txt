After I died, he went on to get ordained, he even officiated my funeral.
Didnt kill her thankfully.
Donated lots of my winnings to charity, spent a lot of time playing poker in my garage with a homeless guy that stayed around the curb, picked up trash in parks.
Either I had been There a lot longer than expected, or the heat death of the universe happened a lot sooner than we all expected.
Eventually we reached what mustve been our 40th or so round and he finally finished his cigar.
Every Ace and every king.
Every plant and every animal.
Every proton and every quark.
Global warming, maybe?Mr.
Guilt finds its way to you after you realize you prevented something really beautiful.
Had an extra set of keys so I could keep the car running and the doors locked, with the car in view.
Had it not been for her drunken behavior, I wouldnt have been put in that situation.
He got his pilots license and traveled the world.
He had eyes of steel as he explained to mine what was happening.
He said I can pick anywhere on earth to spend my eternity.
He said he spoke with the Big Guy.
He spread the message of Christ through a little game called poker.
He told me I was the only person to ever show him love in his long and fulfilling life.
Heat death of the universe.
I couldnt blame her, but that doesnt mean it was all my fault.
I didnt care much for poker at that point.
I got to see her for the six months I was out though.
I had experience being in front of juries, had a lot of experience in prison too so that should tell you something about my experiences with juries.
I knew what shed said, but I didnt listen.
I loved that woman with all of my heart and she despised me.
I met my wife in Vegas after I won a high stakes Texas Hold Em bout.
I shouldnt feel guilty, she said.
I spent 25 of 30 behind bars.
I stayed with her at the pub and put her in the back seat of my car.
I tried to ask him how long or why we were There, but he had a pretty good poker face and a mouth that didnt move for anything but his cigar.
I wasnt perfect, but I didnt want her growing up playing poker, and I wanted her to be safe.
I wasnt surprised when my baby Mary showed up.
I went inside to finish my game of poker.
Id be a fisherman, done with the gambling and tax fraud.
If hed had a nationality, I bet itd be Italian.
It wasnt the child neglect that gave me 25 in the pen.
Juror number two was Nate, the homeless guy I played poker with.
Mary didnt want me playing poker anymore.
Mary wouldve been sitting there had I not grabbed her and left when her mother wasnt looking.
Maybe I jumped to conclusions to quickly.
Maybe this would be my lucky break.4 jurors: the person Ive hurt the most, the person Ive made the happiest, the person whose life ended through my actions, and the person whose life continued from my actions.
Morte went on to explain that God was fair.
Mr Morte left and returned in what couldve been forever or no time at all.
Mr Morte still seemed skeptical.
No place for be down below.
Nobody is without their flaws though.
Not black, just *nothing*.Like what your eyes see in the blind spot.
Nothing was outside and all the lights were off, but it wasnt dark.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Poker and prison._____________________________________________  As I folded my hand for the fifth time, Death seemed to be enjoying himself.
Poker was kind to me and poker was cruel.
Pretty easy choice between the two.
Prison was just mainly cruel.
She had a drinking problem, so Id go play poker and bring Mary with me.
She ran a red light and had a driver hit the rear passenger side.
She was a successful salesperson at a local insurance agency.
She was the one Id cost the most pain.
Spent a few hours there to stay away from drunken love of my life.
The first juror was my wife.
The outside was more empty than the inside though.
The peers werent randomly selected, though.
The third juror was the persons life I saved.
They wrote it off as attempted murder rather than self defense.
Three hots and a cot is as nice as it sounds.
Was he Death?I dont know.
We buried her and my wife couldnt stomach me.
We sat in an empty casino.
Wed live happily ever after.
Wed only played 10 hands but it felt like years, maybe decades.
Well I only knew two things, poker and prison.
What did surprise me, was that it wasnt the Mary I knew.
While at the pub, I decided to get a stuffed bear from the claw machine for Mary.
You can picture my horror when I realized I had both sets of car keys.
