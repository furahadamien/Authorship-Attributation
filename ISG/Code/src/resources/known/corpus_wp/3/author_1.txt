""W-what?I-I can't see, I swear!
"Don't tell them you can see"?I repeated out loud.
"I felt the urgency of his words and was too afraid of being roughed around to protest.
"I have the suspect secured.
"Secure the area and round up all of the 'sighters!
"She said into the comm, then turning to me, "We're going to find out everything we can about your organization.
"She slammed her gun into my head so hard it bounced against the floor and I passed out.\[3\] **PUPIL**  I was aroused to consciousness when I heard the sounds of violence.
"She took me by the arm and subdued me on the ground.
"Shouted the bearded saviour.
"That took her by surprise and she withdrew her weapon.
"The voice was warm and authoritative.
"You shouldn't have let them know you knew about the Great Blinding.
"\[2\] ***Seeing blind - 2 years later***  &#x200B;  "Don't tell them you can see" was sprayed all across the walls in my living room.
&#x200B;  \[1\] ***The Sightless - 2 years ago***.When I was a child my mother would instruct me to put on blindfolds when I had uncontrollable tantrums.
'"called out a heavily armed man of a large muscular build.
Actually, none except for an argument over who got the last tomato paste.
After a solid minute I stood still looking around aimlessly.
And then, my eyes opened once more - "Don't tell them you can see.
As I turned my head around I saw what IT was...A large chirpoteran creature with tentacles standing in place of its face and human arms wrapping around its torso was flying through.
Bodies were here and there, and I knew this.
But that only happened for a month.
But that was the beginning.
But then the streets began to smell cleaner, the air smelled crisper.
Don't tell who I can see?Who are they?Who is them?It wasn't anyone in the food store, was it?No.
Fearing that I was next I avoided sight until I bumped into someone.
Finally she pulled out her hand gun and I faced the business end of the nozzle.
For two whole years I lived like this.
Have you ever fell in garbage before?6-months into the second year of the Great Blinding I noticed I heard sounds that were alien and familiar at once.
He covered his eyes and threw me a knife, "You let it know you can see.
I carefully avoided them the best I could but would sometimes run into one and fall.
I could feel my skin grating against the concrete while her knee was pressed into my back.
I could feel the hairs on my chin itch at the thought of everyone being rescued, and then brought into what?I dismissed the thought as childish wish-fulfillment.
I didn't discard my stick, I kept it on my back as a sort of relic to ward me from the evils that could be reality.
I don't know what other people did.
I feigned blindness, turning my head to face the sound.
I had no hopes of winning this fight.
I heard cars collide into objects, people, animals.
I heard strange noises from the sky.
I noticed the rescuer had a tattoo of a crying eye on his neck.
I pondered what it meant, tugging at my straggly beard, reminding me I needed a shave.
I thought to stand clear.
I took as much ravioli and canned soup as I could manage and carted whatever I could back home.
I tried to resist but only because the floor was hard and it was hot.
I turned around to face my rescuer.
I was blind before The Great Blinding.
I wasn't sure this was a permanent phenomenon.
I would lure animals into my home and butcher them.
I would venture out into the open, occasionally someone else would be on the streets.
I'd imagine there wasn't much people left on my island.
I'm not sure, but four months later I that the light in my eyes opened while on a walk.
I'mguessing that people began to adapt to sightless travel?Who knew.
It was a short man with a bushy beard.
It was as if I was born again.
It was hot, my skin was broken and bruised, I felt pain everywhere.
It wasn't until the morning 4 months later, I think it was four.
It's dangerous out here, we have hijackers and robbers.
Like us, you are a 'Seer', and not a 'Sighter'.We're all over the globe.
Paved roads, houses rebuilt.
People who wish to do you harm.
She got out a pair of handcuffs, which I knew because of the sound.
She has seen violence and has committed it as well.
She put up her hand and waved it in front of me.
She took a step closer until I said, "Who's there?
So we were sighters now?It's amazing the things we invent to disregard humanity, then apply onto one another.
Someone came in my home and vandalized it.
Someone else and another and more have thought the same as I did.
Someone killed themselves, I believe.
Technology like that was probably in development long before; you know how there's always research and development going on?Bah.
The air smelled pungent and sour.
The creature was descending.
The lucky ones who stocked up on canned goods probably fared better.
The radio you heard was us.
The sweat on my face allowed small pebbles to stick to it.
Then she circled around me, stopping in front of my face once she did not see my eyes connect with her movements.
There wasn't much fighting.
There, behind me, was medium framed female with plump lips with a thin scar across the top and bottom.
They're rounding us up and feeding us to 'it'.But we are resisting that.
This is a whole new world I've opened my eyes to, and I plan to survive and see it through.
Two women, a boy, and three other men.
Was it more of those soldiers?I heard a body drop, then gunshots.
We are anomalies!We either become them or stay like us, but once it knows you can see it comes after you.
What in the hell happened?The sun's brightness irritated me for a while until I truly adjusted.
What saved my life was "Don't tell them you can see" which I remembered intimately as it was a great trouble to remove it from my wall.
Where do you live?I'll escort you ba-"  "No need.
Where other kids would get a stern lashing that multiplied by the crescendo of anger, I was given exercises to manage myself.
Where was I going to be taken to?I had no clue.
You PUPILs won't stop until we're all dead.
