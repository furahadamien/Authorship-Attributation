", Dumbledore called the matron as he entered the infirmary.
", he called as he panicked the boy fainted.
"Albus, here the papers you asked", said Minerva.
"Before we begin, may I have Mr Snape's wand first?"
"Did you really afraid of us, Moony?
"Have you read the file I've given to you last week?
"He'll come around I think", said Avery.
"Hogwarts has anti-apparation, no one can apparate within it, even Dumbledore himself, how did you do that?
"How did you apparate in hogwarts ground?
"I heard that you apparate from the lake, is it true?"
"I would like to apologize for not believe you before, " said Minerva with a sadness in her face.
"Is Sev alright?," she asked with concerned eyes.
"It's just" Lily bit her lip.
"Merlin," Dumbledore gasped as he sank to his knees.
"Now, Explain," demand Dumbledore sternly.
"Of course, Albus," Professor McGonagall replied.
"Poppy, can I see Severus's medical file?
"Potter and his gang already punished by Professor Flitwick, detention till rest of the year.
"Severus, does your father treat you well?"
"Stupefy" "Stupefy" Severus was caught both spells squarely in the chest.
"Thank you Sir," she said.
"Thank you for still being my friend" Lily smiled.
"We were just waiting to talk to him," Sirius said, trying to sound and look innocent.
"We... we were just curious how he apparate in hogwarts ground the other day.
"Well, you did the right thing now", replied Poppy.
"What do you think you're doing?"
A group of fifth year, his 'friends' playing chess and exploding snap.
After that she quickly open door and walked in.
Albus looked at him through his spectacle.
Albus looked up to him and stared at the boy.
Albus poured a cup of tea to Minerva as she took a seat in front of him.
All of them were silent till they reached the entrance, Sirius spoke, "it wasn't our fault, he didn't dodge our spell like he did before that" James say nothing, so did Peter.
Apart from injury fighting with marauder, Poppy had detected sign of abuse.
As long as i can get out of there, doesn't matter".
At that time, Lucius already offer him to stay at Malfoy Manor.
Black, Pettigrew followed closely behind.
But she still kept staring at the book looked like she was thinking something else.
Door opened Professor Mcgonagall entered.
Dumbledore asked cheerfully, his eyes were twinkling as always and his mouth chewing lemon drop.
Dumbledore beamed at him.
From his memory, he remembered Lily got Acceptable in history of Magic.
He cast a disappointment look to James especially as this boy was more rational in the last incident.
He continued "There has long been animosity between you four and Severus and now you can see what can happen when bullying gets out of control" "Bullying?"
He coughed up blood and managed to glance towards the Headmaster who was in shocked, then all went dark.
He doesn't care about Potter.
He eyed Dumbledore curiously.
He leaned down gently brushed some of Severus's dark hair out of his eyes and looked into his face the best he could.
He moved away from the head board and pulled her into a hug, but a few tears rolled down his cheek finally.
He never expected the old man would said that.
He smirked inwardly as he knew what to do.
He totally forgot about his wand.
He tried to reached to something, but instead his right hand was grabbed by Dumbledore.
He turned to his study but he noticed Lily was blushing when she saw Potter entered.
He was thinking what Snape said.
Hmm..I'm feel better now", replied Severus as he headed to his bed.
I always made you startled lately."
I can't believe that I was being unfair to him", sobbed Minerva with tears fall down to her cheek.
I even suspended them and took away Mr Lupin prefect badge" explained Albus.
I guess.. it was my fault too.
I had thought all of you had learn the lesson, but I'm wrong", continued Dumbledore, feeling dismayed.
I really wanted to get out of there, far from them.
I told them to leave you alone.
I was there as well when Professor told them," she informed with a satisfied face.
J. K Rowling owns everything ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "Poppy!!
Maybe he really did care.
My door is always open for you, " encouraged Minerva smiling.
Off to the dorm with you," said Minerva.
Poppy cast a curious look at him, stunned at his request.
Remus was leading his friends to the Headmaster's office.
Severus proceeded out of the dungeons.
Severus saw tears in her cheek.
Severus say nothing, looked down to the floor.
Slowly he get off the bed and headed to the washroom.
So, I focused on my Magic, suddenly i was up at Astronomy Tower", he explained softly looking down to his hand.
Then, he silently walked over to his desk and sat down behind it.
Then, just yesterday they almost hex us but luckily James and Sirius were there to save us.
There was definitely disappointment on her face.
There were no any hexes, maybe just harmless--" "Don't you dare use that word in front of me anymore!"
Tonight I caught them", said Albus with a sigh.
gasped Minerva as she saw blood on his robes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Minerva was thinking as she walking slowly in the corridor.
