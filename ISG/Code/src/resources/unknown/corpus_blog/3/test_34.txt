the flight was uneventful except for the quality of the food..But lets not get into that,  the trip to the hotel from the airport was great, with a huge bridge connecting the airport to the main island.. and room i got has a wonderful view of the bay, and in the morning i can see the sun rising over Hong Kong bay, the ideal setting for a morning cuppa.. and nights reveal the city's skyline which is almost as spectacular, and like raisins in a pudding, the star cruise ships keep appearing on the horizon.
