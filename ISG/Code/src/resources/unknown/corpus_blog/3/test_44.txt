urlLink guy got fired for what he blogged... thankfully soccer did happen this sunday, and rain also chose the same sunday morning to happen....but thankfully the rain was more of a bully then a threat, just drenched us and then gave up when we refused to leave the field of play.....  and since i was already having a sore throat and a running nose, the rain did not dampen my health at all....  week has been good so far with pleasant conversations and quite evenings with friends who work in liquor companies, such company always keeps my spirits high.....and these evenings are all the better for happening after loooooong work days,  life is good... as long i have friends, and some soccer in my life, i am content.
