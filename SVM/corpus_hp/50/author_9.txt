Koro-sensei was gone for the day, but someone was still there.
Harry's eyes dulled as he looked up at Karuma.
A couple of people blanched at that, but Harry took it in stride.
Harry didn't know why he felt so antagonistic towards her.
"Let me guess," Karuma smirked, "You were a petty bully and now that you're playing with the big boys…" Harry's jaw clenched, "Not even close.
He took off at Mach twenty, causing a gust of wind to blow over the students.
She was pretty annoyed at the class's insistence that she be called "Bitch-sensei" an unfortunate play on her last name.
One takoyaki ball was stuck into Karuma's mouth before he even had a chance to react.
Nor do I own Harry Potter.
His ultimate goal…was to kill Voldemort and take out his Death Eaters.
Harry took a seat near the back of the class, deciding to stay in the shadows for now.
When the explosion died down he forced himself to look, desperately hoping that Nagisa was somehow okay.
Karasuma started taking over as a teacher in their gym classes, his eyes often times around assessing at the other students.
Harry shook his head, "I'm setting up a trap for Koro-sensei."
Karasuma didn't even look at the woman as he stood stoically, eyes gazing out at the class.
Of course, Harry had his own motives.
Like there was something…dark and dangerous about Nagisa.
"Now that's…straight foreword."
There was a sound of gunfire.
Harry hadn't seen her attempt anything so far, so it came as a mild shock.
