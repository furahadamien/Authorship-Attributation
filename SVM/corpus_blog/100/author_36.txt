Where else to start than the start?
Thus, I present to you the horrifying tale that is my life..     Summary   April 12th, 1990, I was tragically brought into this world by my wonderful parents.
I was nurtured to be a spoilt brat, living in a condominium and having maids, cars, etc.
I can't rememeber anything from the first three years of my life.
Because that's normal.. All I know that I was very doted on by my brothers and parents.
Went to Clementi Woods Kindergarten.
Actually a church, so they taught you Christian songs, and teached you little things about the bible.
Kindergarten was one of the most enjoyable time of my life.
Perhaps, because I was still pure and innocent and not yet exposed to the terrors of this world.
So, despite crying everyday I went there because I couldn't bear to leave my mother, I still very much enjoyed that period of my life.
After turning 6, I was enrolled into Clementi Town Primary School, following the footsteps of all my brothers.
It was an okay school.
More down to earth with realistic teachers and people because it was a neighbourhood school, totally unlike my current school, which is full of pretentious jerks.
I was winning all kinds of prises in Primary one.
Top student, best in maths, etc, etc.. My mother had coached me to study, giving me assesments to do everyday.
At primary two or primary three, I was overfed by my parents and was drafted into the phenominal TAF club.
Cried for one week straight because it meant being publicly humiliated.
The irony of TAF is that it makes students depressed, and we all know that when we are depressed we eat more.. hm.. Primary four is the year that carries the fondest memories with me, partially because it was the year the school building was demolished and mostly because of a teacher that earned our respect.
He was someone who could joke with us yet be strict when he needed to.
And he also had that connection with the students that practically all the teachers I have come across so far severly lack.
Primary four was also streaming year, then, I was not supposed to take Higher Chinese, but my father apparently was able to pursade the higher ups to let me take it.
I was really pissed about that and made a big fuss, but of course parents do everything for our own good, and I could do nothing.
During Primary four I also developed an interest for computer stuff.
Many people in my class were playing neopets, and it was of great help, and till now, web design is still one of my main interests.
Then, in the next year, the school merged with Clementi North Primary, and we shifted to their school compound.
One advantage of being in a neighbourhood school is that you get to meet people from all walks of life, regardless of race religion, monetary status, etc..
So after merging, that exposed me to new people, and despite being in the top class that was full of Chinese, I still got to meet students from the other races.
I don't think I really treasured that, and now that I'm in a Chinese school, there is no interaction with other races and I feel that it's a pity ..
Anyway, time flew, and it was time for PSLE, I don't remember studying much for it, maybe only on the day before the exams.
I had no pressure to do well, or at least I did not feel any.
I also did not expect that I would get 252 for it.
A typical Singaporean would be elated by that.
But my feelings were far from jovial.
My father had put River Valley High as one of the choices, despite me wanting to go to a different school.
Of course, I was powerless to do anything.
So RV it was, one of the gravest mistakes of my life.
I would not elaborate about RV now because it would need another post.
Family   I have a family of six people.
My mother is a Japanese, and my father is a Chinese.
Apparently they met at the University of Hawaii and got married, I have not met any relatives from my mother's side, because they had all passed away at a young age.
For my paternal relatives, frankly, I'm not dying to meet them any time.
My mother is a self-proclaimed high class person, and is interested in Jap literature and music and art.
She is the one who introduced me to art and music, and I also have developed a little interest in them myself.
She is like any mother, hardworking but naggy.
very naggy, and also is lamely funny.. My father is a traditional chinesey guy.
Extremely proud of the chinese culture and language and whatever.
I think I used to communicate to him when I was young, I don't know how or why, but half way we lost the plot.
A very traditional guy, my mother says that the reason she married him is because he was non-violent and gentle.
That is true but he also is strict when he needs to be.
I have three brothers, being 6, 8, and 10 years older than me respectively.
The age gap is apparent, and I find myself blaming my parents for creating me from time to time.
My brothers are mostly okay, occasionally irritating, funny and down to earth.
I don't talk much to them, because I rarely see them, but I'm not complaining about it.
Like all families, my one also has problems.
One of the glaring ones are of course the troubles with religion.
As I said, my father is a traditional guy, and he has objections with my mother, or anyone in the family for that matter, on going to church.
There was more than a few occasions when he would call the family to gather and he would then procceed to lecture us on why we should not go to church and how we were meant to follow our roots which had no part to do with Christianity.
He also says that this would break up the family.
Two of my brothers and my mother are baptised already.
If there is one reason for me not to respect my father, it would be this.
With him being a aethist and thus a scientific person, I cannot grasp how his logic allows him to think that religion would break apart the family.
I know many people that has families with multiple religion, and they are still as happy.
I must admit that the most annoying thing is the prejudice he has against Christianity.
I am a hundred percent sure that if we were Taoist of Buddhist, he would not be protesting at all.
Another glaring problem of my family is of course the financial difficulties that we have.
Recently the house was sold to accommodate our lack of money.
I do not know much about how or why we have financial difficulties but I do know that my father lost a lot, a huge sum, of money.
According to my mother, that was her money that he lost.
She keeps saying that she made the wrong choice in marrying him and the only reason that they are still together right now is because I am still young.
Knowing nothing about what happened, I should not be warranted to comment on this, but what I feel is that she should at least be supportive of him and maybe he should also drop some of his pride and admit that it was his mistake.
Then again, there might be more to it than just what I perceiv.
witching back to blogger, cos ebloggy is forever down anyway.
Basically this blog is mainly about my thoughts, feelings and opinions about everything and anything related to my miserable life.
So if you want to read this, you must be either - more pathetic than me or terribly bored.
Enjo.
appy Birthday     Singapore    !
National Day is here again!
To commemorate this wonderful day, I shall dedicate this post to the country I have stayed in for practically all my life.
Singapore   is a great country to live in, and for the past 14 years of my life, I have had my fair share of encounters with the events, actions, and people from this country.
Therefore, I shall write in this post about all about the things I have experienced that make   Singapore   such a intriguing and interesting place to stay in.
Entertainment    Singaporeans are an easy bunch of people to entertain.
Just look at all the local shows that are shown on TV.
My stupid neighbor always turns on the television at exactly 7.00 and puts the volume at full blast.
So what show is it that is so exciting?
It is none other thanâ€¦ â€¦ drum-rollâ€¦ â€¦ Double Happiness!!
Yes the pointless-cum-lame-cum-just-fucking-stupid Chinese show on channel 8.
Sadly, this isnâ€™t a â€œge4 an4â€ (doing jian3 bao4 comes in handy sometimes), or â€œisolated caseâ€ if your Chinese is somehow worse than mine.
I got a shock of my life this year when I saw the Sun Wu Kong show on   Channel    U.
At first I wondered what all the hype was about because some people from my class were apparently addicted to it.
I thought that the show was probably different and better than the other 23, 854 remakes of the stupid story about an ape-man.
Obviously, I was terribly wrong.
Other than the airing of crappy shows, the   Singapore   media is also obsessed with copying material from other countries.
First there was â€œWho Wants To Be A Millionaire?â€, then came â€œBrainiest Kidâ€, then â€œWheel of Fortuneâ€.
Suitably on National Day, â€œSingapore Idolâ€ will be making its debut and it most definitely would not be stopping at that.
No, I have nothing against creating programmes based on other shows, but what I detest is that every, and I mean every, game show ever made in Singapore is either one that is licensed from another country or one that has its ideas based on another show.
Okay, so thanks to the government, Singaporeans arenâ€™t very creative, but can they fucking please make the shows at least a little incy-wincy bit entertaining?
I really cry when I watch some of the local shows made here and I cannot fathom why Singaporeans can endure this kind of mental torture.
Alas, every cloud has its silver lining, and the people who benefit from all this is those at the broadcasting companies, because they know they are guaranteed an audience, despite how full of bull their shows are.
Singlish  Recently the government has been trying hard, albeit too late, to form a common identity for the good people of   Singapore  .
The slogan â€œUniquely Singaporeâ€ has been appearing everywhere apparently to show that something is unique only to   Singapore  .
The fact is, the only thing that is distinctively Singaporean is Singlish, the cross-breeding of English and other languages and dialects.
And what has been the treatment of this national treasure?
Without the least of respect or due loyalty.
Speaking good and standard English has been encouraged everywhere, in the workplace, at school, and even when talking to your friends, while Singlish has been relegated as the language of the lower-castes and those caught speaking it are viewed as uncouth and uneducated.
The result of this cause is a new breed of Singaporean speaking in pretentious and fake American or British accents.
If you went to a international school or if you are a real Ang Moh, then the accent will come naturally.
Who I hate is those people who put on, or at least try to put on, a fake accent to prove that they are part of the â€œupper-classâ€.
RV recently had this public speaking forum thingy, where 5 or 6 contestants went up to speak on topics.
Practically everyone put on a fake accent, but there was a guy with this irritating and exceptionally phony accent.
The judges told the school that there is no need to put on a fake accent to win a speech competition, but went on to present the first prize to that guy.
It is like telling a child not to play with fire and then proceed to give him a flame thrower.
There is nothing wrong in learning proper and standard English but hopefully the only special thing left in the Singaporean culture will be well kept and treasured by its people.
People  Many people often complain that the place they stay in are very boring and nothing exciting or eventful happens in the area they live in.
I was one of those people until these few months where I started to observe my neighbourhood in search of something to satisfy my craving for fascination.
No, I did not go digging through the grass field, nor did I use my binoculars to spy on that hot babe on the other block.
In fact most of the things that gained my interest were actually people I met.
People that I encountered when I strolled around, when I was coming back to school, or when I was sleep walking.
So here is my list of strange yet amusing characters I met.
Cat-man  : One day, I was coming back from school as usual and had entered my condo compound through the back gate.
There is always a guard on duty at the back gate and that day was no different.
He was this old man, a Chinese, and grandfatherly looking.
Then as I drew closer to him, I noticed that he was patting a cat on the ass and gently singing the words â€œOh you like this?â€ to her/him/it over and over again.
He then proceeded to smile and chuckle as I walked pass him.
If only I met this guy everyday, I wonâ€™t be feeling depressed ever again.
Cat-aunty :  Basically this 80 year old aunty from my block that goes down every night to put cat food all over the compound.
Recently I have not seen her, probably died or got mauled by cats or something.
ACS Idol  : It seems that many interesting people I meet is when Iâ€™m on my way back home.
So here goesâ€¦ As I was alighting the bus, I started to hear some strange and weird noises coming out of nowhere.
Because I was listening to Britney Spears on my Mp3 player, I thought it was probably just her singing.
Then as I walked further down the stretch of road that led to my condo, the noise became more apparent, therefore I took out my earphones.
Realizing that the noise came from behind me, I turned around to see what was making that awful sound.
To my amusement, there was a guy in the unmistakable ACS uniform of white top and navy bermudas, jumping along and cheerfully singing a horrible rendition of â€œI believe I can flyâ€.
At that time I really believed I could stuff his mouth with cat shit, but I put back my earplugs and let him be.
To his credit, he should be commended for being brave enough to sing so proudly and loudly in public.
By the way that stretch of road has semi-detached houses on both sides and the thing that surprised me the most was the fact that the dogs did not come out and tear apart his ass.
I guess dogs communicate well with their own kind.
Rubbish Man  : This guy is really intriguing.
As I was bringing my cheapo Char Kway Teow back home, minding my own business, I met this guy under the void deck of a HDB flat.
Two reasons for calling him rubbish man â€“ When I saw him from afar, he was digging through one of those green rubbish bins, finding who-knows-what, when I walked towards him, he quickly pulled his hands out of the bin and started walking around, pretending nothing happened.
The moment I walked away, he immediately commenced his treasure hunt, digging through the pile of garbage that was in the bin.
Well the second reason was that he really stunk like rubbish.
Smiling Assassin    : Not all the interesting people I have met come exclusively from my neighbourhood, anyone who has studied in RV should know who this person is.
Let me give you a clue â€“ she is a woman that cannot stop smiling and can kill you with her boredom.
Give up?
Itâ€™s none other than the best culture teacher, Ang Geok Hoon!
I am amazed at how she keeps up that megawatt smile of hers and at the same time manage to bombard us week after week with stories about  Peking  men that lived 10,000 years ago which are totally irrelevant to us.
So To Ang Gu Kuey I say : Keep on smiling!
Alex Chiang  : What can I say?
This person sums up just about everything on weird people.
In other words,    Singapore   is generally a weird nâ€™ wonderful country to stay in, and just a few touch ups is all that is needed.
So to all Singaporeans, enjoy the break up anniversary of your country!Yay!!
Got 13:37 for the 2.4km run yesterday.
Feel a sense of achievement, impossible is nothing.
Anyway I'm still in deep shit because I pon cca.
After the run went home to sleep for 5 hrs straight.
