The kids were here on Wednesday and basically we had time to eat and watch a little TV and it was time to take them back home.
I weeded the garden which was way over due.
Now it's close to midnight and I am going to bed, G'night!
I also found tandem hooks to hold the curtain and the liner.
Earlier in the spring we had a momma duck nest under a bush in our front yard.
With that settled we will have no debt other than the mortgage.
I also ordered the shower curtain, liner &amp; rod.
&nbsp;   Yesterday I finally got that last coat of paint on the tiles in the bathroom, YEAH.
We dropped daddy back off and we went in and I payed his bills and played with Midnight a bit.
She then informed me that I had to plant them.
We discussed us moving in with him and eventually getting the house.
Came home and paid a&nbsp;few bills.&nbsp; August can't get here soon enough, by then we should be caught up with finances.
Then of course there is the waiting to try to settle my workers comp claim.
I got the shower stall caulked and tomorrow I will start painting.
WOW, where did this week go?
Last night was the Butterfly Effect.
The new fixtures will have to go about 6" lower to accommodate the drop ceiling and I will need to patch the hole left from the old fixture.
Until next time, CHOW :) Today was our day of rest this week.
Now we are home and getting ready to sit down together and watch a movie but I have no idea what we are going o watch.
Donna, Mike & I were on the cell phones keeping each other updated as to what was going on.
