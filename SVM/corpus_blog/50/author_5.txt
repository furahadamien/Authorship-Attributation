Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .
which, before anything else, makes me feel bad for emily.
since this...no emily in arizona thing... other peopleve been annoying me a lot.
i think she liked my photos.
huzzah for the book and kyle.
i wish i was better at knowing what people really mean when they say things.
so then i was trying to figure out why im so childish...and my only theory at the moment has to do with unconditional love and the methods most familiar (or those i consider most appropriate) to me of expressing said emotion...but i kind of dont feel like getting into that because...thats a whole...pandora's box...can of worms...kinda thing.
You could close your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people said because you never belonged here anyway and nobody could make you sad and nobody would think you're strange because you like to dream and dream.
cares about my fencing stuff anyway.
i love how something like that can totally ruin my moderately good mood though... how i can never just be free from worrying about emily stuff.
when i was little i thought that might be superpowers.
So, since i dont feel like doing my spanish essay right now...
must go work on essay/speech now.
i feel bad for people who are confused as to who they are.
after the "oh crap, im not original anymore" part....thats really really funny.
If you love anyone, and I mean you can say "I love you" without cringing a little on the inside because you know it's not absolutely true beyond a doubt... then you love them unconditionally.
So, duh, we only do everything because itll make us feel good...because we want to.
and now im not making any sense... but tahts okay!
theyre not...emotional/moral unrest rants.
Happy...in that "the world doesn't owe me anything" way.
