We waited so long for her.
I am trying to keep my mind off of this.
Then i told him it wasnt me but he said i have had a bad attitude problem, lets wonder why!
Everyone has made me feel so welcomed.
My emotions are already very sensitive, imaging now.
My arms are killing me from my crutchs and my foot is now blue, but worth it...
Day by day... That is the only way to heal and get her strenght back.
Im so happy for her and her family!
Is it just me or do I cry to easily or what???
I am going in on October 8th....
One question to all the teachers out there..... WHY....
My brother Dan and his wife Janice , who is an incredible person, mother and also help me go thru very hard times and showed me the way to God, without pushing.
It will be exciting although i will probably have some axiety attack because walking down an isle with people watching kind of freaks me out.
People who know me and have not seen me in a year or so, cannot believe the changes in me and my family.
I hope when school starts, my life could be back to normal posting and chit-chatting.
Dear God,  Don't know if you noticed but...
and do not even think of posting a comment in my site sweetie.
which won't be before the fall.
It made me so sad to think that even though we are all family, as a whole we really arent.
The girls had so much fun with the cousins.
