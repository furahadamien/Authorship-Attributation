I updated my blog...Your move - Jeff Nice..I think I just discovered I can make a blog entry by just clicking a butoon on my browser.
That was the highlight of the overall crappy show, the award intros were scary as hell, there were too many commercials, the other bands weren't very good, it was prerecorded.
So If anybody read this...Thanks...I need readers...ART...The ball is in your court now.
I love that show, and plus I discovered that..Hold on, Viva La Bam is back on...Ok I'm back, I love Viva la Bam.
Or maybe its because I decided to have my own mini Freaks and Geeks marathon.
Just wait until I see it again..Game over...I will lay the smack down...With my sore arm and everything.
Good quality too..Well its almost 5 so I think I am going to take a nap.
I made a couple of good catches, too bad my hitting sucked today...But I digress.
I can watch any baseball game I want...Streaming live on the internet...FANTASTIC!
Working 7pm-7am (you read right) will do that to you.
And it must've been my lucky day, because the band happened to be Santa Rosa, CA's finest...Diesel Boy, one of my favorite bands...SCORE!
cuz the pistons just raped your team, buddy!!
Some people made some crappy plays and we gave up our 8 friggin point lead...What the crap?
Maybe its because my sleep pattern is all screwed up.
But back to Freaks and Geeks, I was watching an episode tonight and they went to a punk club, there was a band playing.
I really like the Beastie Boys.
And while we're on the subject of sports, I'm loving the NBA finals.
urlLink    I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Olsen twins a happy 18th birthday!!!
It turns out that since I signed up for cable internet I get the rest of the season free on MLB.
Nothing better than watching the lakers get whooped!!
