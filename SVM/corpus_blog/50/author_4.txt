I really hate the mission statement of our year- "Trustees of the Universe" but in some elitist way I feel it's true.
More later, gotta dash now.
Most husbands avenge their honor quickly, with a blade, settling for retribution but not for justice.

But feck it all, I'm going to at least try.
Or that I would be able to accept failing at one.
Then it was field day- volleyball, in which I earned a reputation for taking nosedives- and ultimate frisbee, which nearly killed me a couple of times.
Four stories of brick and dormitory goodness.
