Well, that was certainly a learning experience.
I think it's about time I bought my own armour.
Everything needs to be broken in; I'm in the process of breaking in the kote by rotating the fist section in relation to the cuff and I've stored the men with the futon in the correct position.
Eventually, I loosened up a bit and things got a bit better.
Afterwards, I felt like I was floating; ah, endorphines, a gift from the gods no less!
If it is lighter, I'm not sure if I can add something to it to make it heavier.
Well, I've finally got off my arse and have found a dojo in Bangkok and I have my first practice on Saturday.
I have fairly good control over the kensen during suburi, without squeezing the tsuka, so I think this is why I've been neglecting proper tenouchi.
Probably, but at the time I was a little pissed off.
I didn't wimp out when I thought I was going to pass out; I kept on going until the proper breaks came along.
I've actually been thinking about it for a while (probably a couple of years at the most), and have been ridiculed by certain friends for contemplating starting, 'cos apparently it's not useful unlike jujitsu or kung fu.
I bought a standard machine set (#504) from  urlLink Kendoshop .
I've added extra weight to the end of my shinai, but the only things I could find were 4 masonary drill bits, which I've taped to the mono-uchi.
Apparently, I'm eligible to take part in the next ASEAN Kendo Tournament in 2007, because I have Thai nationality.
I think it's probably because I didn't think about what I was doing.
They were both amazing and they made the 4th and 5th dans look like beginners again.
The tournament is tomorrow.
I'm not squeezing the tsuka like a should be; doing so would lock my wrists and stop me over extending them when I miss.
Today I managed 400 with the added weight, and by the beginning of next week I shall be up to 1000 a day (only on days that I don't have practice, which is Monday to Thursday).
I seem to be neglecting tenouchi.
