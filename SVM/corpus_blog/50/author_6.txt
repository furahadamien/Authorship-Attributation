the parents had to come home early because i just couldn't take it and i was trying real hard not to cry anymore.
laughing at the most inappropriate moment.
last week i briefly went out with someone.8th guy this year to ask me out.
she pushes me away, so i pick her up kicking and screaming and took her into the house.
but really, does she really need 2 fuckin' bags?
jake and i went to trader joes again and got some more MOCHI!!!!!
so then i suggested seeing Envy b/c it looks like a good-ass movie.
i have to go think of better things...like my own sex with my own boyfriend.
maybe it was that violent outburst i had at lunch that one day... who knew throwing chairs and knocking people unconscious turned people off.
im more at ease here and i dont need shit like that when im living at home.
now, i know i've already addressed my hatred for the eric clapton wannabe, but i just have this weird appreciation for anything cheesy.
so...its not exactly what i thought...but then again, i wasnt sure what the fuck was going on anyway.
it was only for about 5 minutes, and when i got back, i found that she had called and also that my mother had left a message.
Addie Bo Badass i thought i only had to babysit dina and liam (who, by the way, are really good kids), but as it turned out, i had to babysit their two cousins as well.
they have subs made of just veggie oils.
if you don't, i won't be your friend anymore!
Lacey- im sooooooo sorry for ditching you!
mood:self- loathing music:"bandages"-hot hot heat                                    .i am a piece of garbage.
mood: wishing i was partying music: "here in my room"- incubus  It's so unfortunate that im babysitting right now.
