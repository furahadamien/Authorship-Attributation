Micki, I REALLY hope you can make it home this weekend, because it's Central Lee Invitational...and I'm gonna make you come if you're back.
There were some really good show choirs there (better than we expected).
Yea, I go in and the manager tells me what I have to do...I was thinking, "Oh my freakin' God!"
It's gorgeous though, I just hope it fits right.
State all three groups (band and the 2 choirs) got 3's!!!
Last night I worked and my Chinese manager had no idea about three of us moving to grocery, and he was very very mad.
I'll still look for another job though.
I start my summer English Composition class tomorrow morning (8-11 AM).
I had to scrub everything--the walls and all these little cracks filled with dust and dirt piles.
Look is the key word, no one is really hiring.
I did forget about that by the time the movie started.
After that, Micki picked me up and we saw Spiderman 2 in Ft. Madison.
I just got done playing basketball and some baseball.
I had already seen it, but it was such a long time ago, it seemed like the first time again.
Then, Sunday I had to work 4-10 but I got sick at work and had to leave early.
So, we sat down and before we ordered our food, Micki realized she forgot her wallet at home (which consisted of all her money).
We only have 18 ordered, and we need to get more or else you wont be getting them.
I had a funny blonde moment yesterday...Micki and I had to go into the grocery store to pick up hot dogs, buns, and bread.
So, we got to the buns, and I started to say, "We need bun length buns".
Pretty good weekend so far.
