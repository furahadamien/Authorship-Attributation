I should have paid more attention to the time spent sprinting and recovering as I'm not sure I pushed myself long enough.
Meet my new best friend, the pull float.
BTW, Martin and I are hoping to increase our swim program to 2000 meters in a week or so.
Marc showed me a series of exercises to do with every run to improve it.
Will see how quickly I can adjust to it.
For now, I have couple sentences in my memory â€“ base building, base building, base building, and one more base building.

urlLink Martin  turned me on to  urlLink Marc Evans ' training methodology and I've decided to reworking my training zones to follow the the approach described in  urlLink Triathlete's Edge .
By the end of my run (1hr 30min) my core was pretty pooped.
If that fails, I'm gonna try screaming "Out Satan!"
65 steps per minute compared with 90-95, which is optimal.
A little training retrospective, if you will.
The trade off is higher HR.
This race looks to be a good gentle introduction to the sport.
12:00  12:05  12:40  9:57  9:07  9:51    BTW, the slower split times were taken when I was running with my training partner.
Never the less, the 1.5 hr 1500 meter swim program was hard to do immediately after the 1 hour run.
Think I'll sign up for the 50 miler.
Oddly, using the pull buoy feels a lot like swimming with a wet suit on which I will be doing in the race.
My running suffered the most this week due to improper planning and fatigue.
It seems that bouncing was inducing the problem.
