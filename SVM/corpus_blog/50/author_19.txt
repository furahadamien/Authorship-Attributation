I am shaping up a bit, with eating better and exercise .
Over the weekend Allison and I made a quick stop in a grocery store in Ecorse.
OMG it's 10:30am already!
Too many jokes, not enough time.
I guess I'll give it a while and see if the job goes anywhere.
I didnt want just any dog.
He is even getting along with Baby our pissy fat cat.
everything should be made as simple as possible,  but not simpler.
I think I may be getting too old for these kind of movies?
Wait this is my blog I can say fucking if I want to, it hurst so  mother fucking  much!
Have been for about a year now.
I am sitting here thinking, I can't believe I have to get up  and leave early in the morning.
I liked the template when I saw it,  but still have to get use to such a girlie / flowery look.
While we were out shopping, out of no where she told me "I know what I want to name my new baby sister!"
I have never used the Netscape before, is there a setting I need to fix?
I have so many new ideas, products, and a website.
The real crazy mom's who will kick, scream and fight over the last Barney DVD because they have to have it 50% off  or they are just going to die, or kill some one trying,  yeah... That could be me.
Here I sit in front of this computer still in my robe.
Things I am thankful for : 1.
I am sad that all the very nice thoughts and support that everyone left me on my comments over the past week were deleted in the process.
