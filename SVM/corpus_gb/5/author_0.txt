"I guess," said he at last, "that I'm not so smart as I thought I was, and I've got a lot to learn yet."
There are plenty more on the bushes, and all I've got to do is to pick them.
"Perhaps if we wait until he comes out again, he will come over here," said Sammy Jay, who had joined Blacky.
"I guess some one else was hungry too," he muttered.
"If I whistle," thought he, "everybody will know just where I am, and will keep out of sight, and I never can get acquainted with folks if they keep out of sight."

"Don't you believe I'm telling the truth?"
Probably he is the thief himself."
He gave a deep, angry growl that made little shivers run over Chatterer, and then suddenly he started up that tree after Chatterer.
Unc' Billy Possum chuckled.
Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could see.
Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself.
Both anger and fear make it do that.
So when he started to look for berries, he made up his mind that he would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the Green Forest before Farmer Brown's boy was more than out of bed.
But to have Sammy Jay call everybody within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand.
You see, there isn't much of anything that Farmer Brown's boy is really afraid of.
If I live long enough I'm going to get even with him!"
But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown's boy meet face to face; and while it was true that Farmer Brown's boy had run away as fast as ever he could, it was also true that Buster Bear had done the same thing.
