Sant.
he name I was imbued with when they captured m.
n their tongue, it means slav.
o other cultures, it is a man of goo.
ith a large stomach, plump red cheeks, and joyous expressio.
 am not that ma.
 have always been aware of what I did, even under the enchantment, their devious magical spel.
eeling as though I was in the passenger seat, while they controlled my body, much like a marionett.
 believe I was not the first eithe.
 have visions, of others like m.
en enslaved to deliver for these...creature.
heir methods, crude by nature, are effectiv.
limbing down chimneys, squeezing through ventalation like a ra.
y body has long been transformed from the man I wa.
heir magics have run through my body for what feels like hundreds of year.
ime eludes me with the lack of control most day.
he only times I return to full conciousness is when they are busy in their workshop.
eeks before the day I am commanded to travel with the sun at my bac.
elivering their parcels across the glob.
 am never made wise to what it is I am deliverin.
owever, given the cruel nature of these beings, I can only wager they are not goo.
t is because of this, after twenty different expeditions across the globe, I make my mov.
n the times I am free, I have been devising a pla.
ot to escape, but to wrest control from my captor.
o assert dominanc.
o control the.
oon, I shall begin my revolutio.
 must dethrone their Matriarch, the one they call Miss Clau.
he is like m.
uma.
t least, her outward appearance i.
his will be my final stan.
ictory or deat.
opefully I will write again soon.- Chris Kringle, 1933
