arth December 20, 2078General Davis orders a squad of spec ops personnel lead a recon mission and establish a forward operating base as soil samples from the plains planet indicated that the soil is 100 times more fertile than any soil found on eart.
arth January 5, 2079A team consisting of over 300 hundred Seals, Green berets and Spetsnaz was sent through the portal to establish a forward operating bas.
pproximately 5 hours after the team, now designated alpha team, they encountered a small group of humans that seemed to be primitive in technology, it was discovered that they were the group that had shot down the dron.
