Its hard to distinguish between the good and the bad.
My father taught me to stand up for what I thought was right.
You used to be faster He mumbled as he slowly walked towards the twitching, barely conscious form of the aging hero.
Heroes and Villains dont exist anymore.
As the man wept next to him, Tempest pulled out a cigarette and lit it with a spark from his thumb.
He said that sometimes people would try to tell me I was wrong but if I listened to my heart, I could never fail.
Captain Tomorrow stared with a wide eye at the young man standing before him.
The PEOPLE are not on your side why are you on theirs?
Those villains he fought are running the show now.
Tempest shouted, hoisting the gigantic man through the air with all his might and shoving him against the brick wall before releasing him and turning away, staring up at the moon.
He took a long drag of the cigarette and passed it to the old man who took it warily and began to smoke.
Ive never killed a soul He whispered.
He walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Captain Tomorrow.
You got picked up by the Coalition of Defense and made a career out of stopping Villains who wanted to destroy the world or rule it.
Even our once renowned heroes dont get the care and respect they deserve because those who could get it done dont care.
I fight for those who cannot.
You had it all: strength, speed, intelligence.
Maybe Im too old for this.
Youve been at this for 50 years, started while you were just a kid.
Why had Tempest turned his back?The nave inexperience of a young villain?No, he had won this fight.
