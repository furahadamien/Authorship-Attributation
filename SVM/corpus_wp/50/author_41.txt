My job was to escort the poor lost souls from this world to the next.
I, Master of Death, who always swore I was no thief, stole the lives of millions in a day.
I used my power to end the blights infecting plants that humans and remaining animals needed for survival.
At first I only helped those dying of infectious diseases, humans whose frail bodies could no longer fight off the bacteria or parasites that had invaded them.
Something needed to be done.
ButI think that was the first time in my existence that I felt truly tired.
These souls were strange, to say the least.
The souls just before the War had felt no fear when I came to them, often greeting me coldly, as if they had expected me to come for them sooner.
Life slowly began to adapt to its changed world.
There are countless lives, but there is only one Death.
I had never taken an active role like this, and I did not want to interfere too much; much as I feared myself, I still worried about upsetting the Way of things.
I didnt want to upset the Way of things, but I could no longer simply be Death and let their souls come to me.
I searched out each victim as I felt their lives expire, collected their poor lost souls, and brought them to their new home.
I had been everywhere at once, in the same place hundreds of times at once.
I had to do something more.
Within two years I had stolen billions.
I could not do much to help those infected by powerful viruses, seeing as my power had little effect on something with so little life in it.
I had tried so hard to deny its inevitability.
I do not feel sadness anyway, not in the way the mortals do.
In the age before humanity, they hardly greeted me at all, were hardly even aware of my presence.
