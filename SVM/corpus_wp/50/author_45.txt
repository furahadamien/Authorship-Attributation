She didn't sound the least bit offended.
But that 9999 above her head still had me puzzled.
She looked at me seductively and quietly said, Yes.
It didn't affect my ability at all, as long as I could make out the numbers.
Glancing at the somewhat empty bar, I spotted a flash of golden hair.
That was her, still all alone, somehow.
Why would you want to be a bouncer?I can't blame my friends for thinking that way, of course.
And without realizing I was on her sofa with this jaw-dropping woman next to me.
After a while the monotony did begin to get annoying.
After taking way too long, I let her in.
Some of the same faces, some new.
And then one that was new, but had to be old.
Below that number, all alone, was a stunning blonde.
The ride there was a blur, I was too confused, and she was to stunning not to be focused on.
Checking IDs was just a formality.
Gnawing at the back of my mind was still that number.
There were some real model types that came here but, this one, she was something else.
So, uh, this may sound weird but, your ID said you're 23, and, I uh, you look a bit older, ah, yeah.
Stunned, it came to me, that that God damned Loch Ness Monster tricked me again.
*Thanks for reading this!Ive never commented here before, but this ending came to me as soon as I read the prompt.
