I immediately regret what I just said.
Satan smokes a cigarette, blowing the smoke in my face.
"You could start a fire or something.

"No sign of them, but I doubt they've decided to leave us alone now," he confirms, but he continues looking.

This is the first time I've actually snapped at my companions - they all have their faults, but I've always been polite about it.

He pats me on the back - a bit forcefully, but then again, everything he does is forceful.
**"I've been wondering how long it would take you to actually stick up for yourself!
He tosses the cigarette out of the semi truck with his other hand.
I drive through the destroyed landscape that was once Heaven, barely managing to avoid the various holes in the clouds.
"Ugh, how many times have I asked you to stop smoking?
So, as it turns out, Heaven and Hell are the same place.
