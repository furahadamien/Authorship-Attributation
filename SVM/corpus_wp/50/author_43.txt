We grow up learning green is good, red is bad but these were celestial lines.
I'd never followed the red line, and even though I was still walking the green, technically I was following the red too.
Dark, damp and dimly lit I followed as the line took me around another bend and I stopped in my tracks.
The black line grew, pulsating thick and thin as if to taunt me.
I stood there for a few minutes, looking off to the right, my eyes locked on that pulsating red line.
Surely they'd been around longer than traffic lights?I made up my mind, today was the day.
I headed off following the red line.
Weeks turned to months and my surroundings continuously changed as I went country to country.
It had come to a point where I barely even noticed the red line anymore, why would I it was always behind me.
Thin, sickly with very little wispy hair.

".He hopped on one of the scooters and started it up, screaming off down a small street.
Could he see it too?His eyes widened as he revealed a smile with very few teeth left where they should have been.
He was topless, wearing rags just to cover his privates.
It was then I looked down and noticed it.
I'd been seeing the lines since my 12th birthday.
It had taken me about 2 months before following the green line stopped making me nervous, after that I always knew I was safe and headed for something good.
