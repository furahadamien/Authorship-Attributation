I snap back to reality when the tiny bit of bread in my hand falls to the ground.
I don't know where they come from.
Because the most dangerous days are when memories overwhelm me, and those saccharine, fat filled biscuits contain nothing but memories of happier times.
Memories come rushing in like a flood, and even the palest shadow of happier times paralyzes me with sadness.

I will collapse under the weight of all my loss, all the pain I have buried inside me.
The future looks bright._____________  The foolhardiness of youth.
