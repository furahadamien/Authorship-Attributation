Time to get moving,  the man in black said.
If things could have been a little different.
All of that walking seems to have finally caught up with me.
You sleep and I'll take watch.
Where the fuck am I?I looked all around and saw nothing but sun and sand in all directions.
''I've never heard anything like it, but somehow it made me forget about all the mistakes I had made in my life.
It is, The Gunslinger said.
It will be okay](https://www.
Those things last night, the demons, I began to ask.
Can you at least tell me where are you taking me?
I swear we passed the same cactus and boulder a dozen times.
The darkness finally started to give way to sunlight and the demons disappeared into the desert.
I have lost my job, my family, even my kids hate me.
I asked looking out across the desert seeing nothing but what looked like the same cactus and boulder up ahead I had seen many times before.

The Gunslinger moved back closer to the fire and unleashed hell with his guns taking out one after the other.
Maybe when I wake up Ill be back in bed and this weird dream will be over.
If one small thing could have been different.
When I look back at my life, I know I wasted the last few years of my life.
They were going to swarm us.
