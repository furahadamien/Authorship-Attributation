**August 2, 1910**  Bob told me that if I was to apply to art school in June, I would need to do better than just improving.
I thought this was the end, one of them had finally bested me, but I was wrong.
After a brief argument, he convinced me that I had it in me to become a great artist.
In fact, he had me keep going with what I had.
I would need to be flawless.
Had the doctors have been quicker, they could have saved him.
His name is Bob Ross, hes from 1994, and he has come to the past to educate people in the dying art of painting.
His patience is incredible.
I did my best, but I could tell that it was unsatisfactory.
In other news, Bob has developed a nasty cough.
After Bob Ross sacrificed his life so that I could succeed and bring back artistry, I failed.
**May 19, 1911**  Bob Ross is dead.
Bob Ross is the last painter, and he wants to revive the art, even if it means he can never go back to his own time.
He told me to meet him in the back alley by the homeless shelter tomorrow morning.
I asked Bob what he thought.
Not good, but better than my past accomplishments.
As Bob told me every day, anyone can paint.
He said that he wanted to teach me to paint.
Perhaps it makes me look like a murderer from his time.
Apparently, my generation has many sub-par painters who cause a chain reaction, destroying art as we know it.
