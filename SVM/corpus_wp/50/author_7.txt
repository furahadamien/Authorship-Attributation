The headline- it cant be.
And then she wonders, why would I feel bad about taking something that shouldnt be there anyway?Why would I feel anything at all when I used to be a super villain?If thats who I was, is it really as simple as erasing memories to change someones identity, values, morals?The Oblivion, after erasing everyones memories, integrated the villain safely back into society.
What if there are more like this?What if there are newspapers of other villains?The most powerful supervillain.
It was for a type of english class, and she needed a newspaper story to write about.
She is sitting on the floor of a library, trying to find something, anything, of interest for her project.
The Oblivion couldnt take anything but memories.
She makes it through the library, the newspaper undetected in her bag.
Which explains how she had no idea how she got into the college she did, or that apartment.
Quickly Talia stuffs the newspaper in her handbag.
So... then what?Have fun, Talia supposes.
Slowly, she picks it up and holds it closer to her face.
One newspaper catches her eye.
TALIA LIANTRA- THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL SUPERVILLAIN and under that, it proceeds to tell of how she destroyed three major cities, completely and utterly leveling them, and then how shed burned the surrounding areas and other countrysides.
Talia sighs, smoothing her hair behind her ear.
It is mostly under another newspaper, but she brushes it off.
No, no... Talia cant believe it.
And then, lower on the page.
She isnt supposed to take the newspapers out of the library but shed be toast if anyone saw this.
If she could get those back... Talia isnt sure.
and then nothing after that.
