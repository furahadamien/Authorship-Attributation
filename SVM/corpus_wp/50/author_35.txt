"I'LL FUCKING KILL YOUR MOTHER, YOUR SONS, AND YOUR COWS"  I said as calmly as I could.
"I rose from my seat, chains tried to hold me down.
The tall gray man arose from the desk, his nose sharp like an eagle's beak.
He was analyzing me, coming up with a plan of attack, taunting me.
"I turn my attention back at the skeleton in a suit.
I slumped back in to my seat, giving in to the chains.
"Your going to be begging for me slit your throat!But I fucking won't!You deserve to die here along with the rest of the non-believers!You're all pigs!Each and every one of you pigs!Fuck your this court, the judge and the jury.
With each stomp my anxiety grew inside me.
Each pound of the hardwood floor adding a new layer of anger and impatience.
"May the almighty Jim Carrey have mercy on your soul, because I sure won't!""
His eyes were pointed at me, but he wasn't looking at me.
"where did you acquire the dagger?
"it was bad enough that he didnt look at me when he talked, but he enunciated every sound , drew out  pauses between words, and said them all in his pretentious English accent.
I'm a fucking hero!I'm saving everyone that I killed, but you all are to blinded to realize.
"I yell only a slightly bit louder than I been talking.
"Dexter" he said, not to me, but to our audience.
"You all blame the Jews when the vegans are the ones who truly blinded you.
They put you against each other and led to our demise.
The room was loud with silence, eyes shifted between us- looking at him, back at me, then back to him as he took deliberate stomping steps towards me.
No further questions" he said smugly as he walked back to his desk.
