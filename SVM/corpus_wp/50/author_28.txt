Under my welcome mat, there was a key.
"My mom smiled back at me, "Now we can come and visit you any time we want.
"Her tears instantly vanished, and she went back to rearranging my furniture.
But, after I kicked it, I saw something gold sticking out from underneath it.
But, it wasn't really something I particularly wanted, or even cared about having.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against welcome mats, they're fine.
They would complain about drama-filled lives, or complain that I wasn't calling them often enough.
Just a gray mat with the word "Welcome" on it.
They kept finding excuses to come and visit me.
So, it's not like I had one already.
I was glad I wouldn't be seeing them again for a while, but on the off-chance they would come to visit me, I wanted them to see I was using their gift.
"Then she started to cry.
"What?Is your own mother not allowed to visit?I didn't realize I wasn't welcome here.
Then, I saw that stupid welcome mat still sitting there.
I honestly didn't even know how she got in.
I stared at her in disbelief, in front of the still-open door, as she nattered something about how I should really not have the TV across from the window."...
It just got more and more frequent the longer I lived away from home.
I kicked it in frustration.
It didn't even reflect anything about my style or interests.
They're the sort of thing that you don't buy when you first move into a new place.
