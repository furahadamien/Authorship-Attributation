"Ya'know, I'm glad I never had kids, look at everyone freaking out!This is like Christmas!Maybe we can go home early, you know Boss has already left, aren't you a little curious what you're number is?
"Do you have it in your hands?
"Steve's brow started to furrow as his wife's body language wasn't looking good.
?He Doesn't even have kids!
Clink!Clank!Everything was getting shifted... where was it?It had been here this morning when he left!Why didn't he grab that mug instead?

"Bill flashed a quick smile, his entire face was red and shiny, his mustache a common intruder to his lips looked like a used workshop broom.

"Steve pulled up into his driveway, and couldn't contain his curiosity and booked it for the cupboard.
Steve's eyes were as big as saucers, the number...."Is Blank?

"Steve interrupted, he made a grab for the mug and she obliged.
"Nah, not yet it's at home" Steve was trying to hide his disdain, somehow out of EVERYONE IN THE WORLD his Asshole Manager gets the #1!
"Oh, Hey Bill" Steve was on auto pilot.
