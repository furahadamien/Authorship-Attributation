he started, "Did you swap out Dad's mug?
"Of course Paul wasn't up yet, so I went to Ian, sitting on the computer in his bedroom.
I'll write another entry tonight.
He kept looking at the mug and looking at my face.
The one with the little bird.
I still don't know what any of this means.
I have to take the kids to school.
1 Apr.2019  9:35 am  Dear Diary,  This morning, I reached into the kitchen cabinet to grab my husband's mug for his daily cup of coffee.
His smile slipped away and his face transformed into a look of genuine concern.
The look in his eyes reminded me of the time we told him that his pet rabbit had died.
He told me, "Mom, look what's trending.
""No, mom," he shakily replied, "look at this.
"Ian swiveled around in his chair.
*"  On screen, he had one of those social media sites up.
I must have whispered it under my breath, because Ian began explaining that because of Nixon's fiasco at Watergate, people have begun to use the "-gate" suffix to describe a scandal.
He showed me photos of mugs that had "#693,200 Dad" on it, mugs that had "1337,000,000" which was apparently significant, and all kinds of other numbers.
There was so much going on in the screen I couldn't concentrate.
"*He's always got his face in that machine,*" I thought, "*of course he's trying to distract me with something unrelated.
When I felt for the mug and took it from the cabinet, I realized it was different.
Or at least, I *thought* that I had thought it.
