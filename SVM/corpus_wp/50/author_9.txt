Not good, not bad, just nothing.
Prison isn't doing them any favors, either, especially not being trapped here with us.
I mean that literally -- these are not the kinds of people who get away with things.
You see, it has a unique rule: If we get out, so do they.
And that really is the crux of the matter.
Hell, with their luck, they don't even get away with stuff they didn't do.
Half of them, to be precise.
When they picked me up, there was no fire, and no brimstone.
The having a personal deus in my machina, Jesus levels of karma kind of lucky.
So they put me in here, with the other lucky ones.
Half the inmates here are like me, lucky as all hell.
That if you could lock up a tornado or imprison an earthquake, you should.
The other half, well, they're just about the most unfortunate bastards you'll ever meet.
So you're probably wondering how the hell I ended up in prison, and more than that, how the hell do they keep me here?Well, predictably, they picked me up in Vegas.
Just a calm judiciary in a black robe explaining that people like me are too dangerous to have around.
It was stupid, I know, but like I said I'm not that clever, and I was pretty high at the time.
And that's the key to this place.
I got picked up about a week into my binge, living it up in the MGM Mansion after having arrived in town with about a hundred dollars to my name.
We don't do preparation, we don't do planning, and we don't do consequences.
We aren't a leaf on the wind, we are the wind, a god damned force of nature.
