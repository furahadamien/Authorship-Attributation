I looked closer and right next to the second zero, I can see another faded out zero, making my rating read 1000.P.
S.This is my first edit any and all criticism would be appreciated!Thank you!
Thank God Maxis hasnt sold me.
I was shown to my room and got in the shower and cleaned off the rubble and scrubbed dirt out of every crevice of my body.
Every once in a while other countries would try to attack Maxis, this was because as a Hundred, you can often times predict the future, and some are better than others.
Luckily, Ive never been injured.
Ive been in many myself, killing more people than I can count.
All my life Ive lived in Maxis, the most secure prison in the world.
When I was born, I was immediately transported to Maxis.
People at Maxis are the most dangerous people in the world... the Hundreds.
I was the only survivor and I somehow didnt have a single scratch on me.
Full out fist fights, shanks, taking the officers guns and more.
Sirens were going off and we all had to go into our cells... then the bombs hit.
Once I got out of the shower, I noticed something on my arm next to me tattoo.
It was like the world was falling apart in front of me, with horrific screams and blood all around me.
I woke up 2 weeks later, or thats at least what Ive been told from the people who took me in.
When you are born you have numbers on the back of your arm, this is your luck rating.
One of these attacks from Nigeria was stronger than weve ever experienced.
Most people born with 1 dont make it past age 3, and most people with 100 dont die before 175.I was one of those lucky ones born as a Hundred.
Im the number one rated predictor in the world and people have a lot of money set down to buy me.
