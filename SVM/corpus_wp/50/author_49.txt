"How is that even possible...?
"I ask  She looked at me confused."Well...
Bottom line is, we were now inseparable."Say...
It sounded distant and quiet, but I could still make up the words.
I turned around and began walking home.
Ever since that morning at the coffee shop, it was impossible for the two of us to be apart for a long period of time.
"I'm just so glad you're real..."   There was no longer an effort to control herself.
We essentially went out every single day after work.
"Say...I'll see you again tomorrow?
"After that remark, the two of us remained quiet for the rest of the way until we finally reached her apartment complex.
An offer that I literally, could not refuse.
"It's like... we're soul mates.
She wore glasses, had short black hair, and was on the short side when it came to height.
Tears flowed down her eyes, and her sobs drowned out the chatter of the coffee shop.
I didn't know what to say; what *could* one say in a situation like this?Instead of offering some kind words, I sat next to her and took her in my arms.
Instead of a sad expression, what greeted me was the most beautiful smile, along with tears running down her ivory skin.
The two of us walked down the street at high hours of the night, our hands held together.
There it was again... that familiar little voice I've been hearing all my life.
Yet, despite all my beliefs and ideals, there she stood.
She invited me for some coffee.
