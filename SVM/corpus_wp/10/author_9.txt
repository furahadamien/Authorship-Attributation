The question of morality lingers at the back of my head.
I look down on the blade, glimmering in the moonlight.
I dont even know why I did it.
In one swift motion, I climb through the door, unsheathe the dagger, and stab him in the back.
The dagger does something to a person.
Eerie silence fills the night.
He is turned away from me now, an opportunity which I take.
The rich and greedy have nothing to contribute to the new world.
I dont even know if all Ive done was worth it.
*, The whispers in my head growing louder and louder, like a cyclone of emotions, filling every crack in my mind, until they all stop, and all I hear is deafening silence.
Buildings are starting to crumble as the shaking grows more intense.
* Its time*   * I toss it aside*  I bring out the pistol in my holster, and shoot myself hit the head.==========================  This is my first time doing this, comments would be appreciated.
*  Perhaps maybe the dagger hasnt sucked the life out of the ones Ive killed, but maybe its been sucking out *my life*.I feel the earth tremble, realization  striking me.
I was one of those few good people.
On my next expedition, I found it buried underground in a burial room.
*  All these atrocities Ive done, all the lives lost, are actually lives gained, I try to tell myself.
The people on the other side may see me as a hero, but here I am a fugitive.
* He seems to be working, and I glance closer.
*Or maybe my next victim*   It seems weird, the feeling I mean, of taking a life.
I wonder to myself whether this man has a family, has friends, perhaps children.
