As they nearly finished cutting the tree I made a very small root come out of the ground and trip Lily.
Sorry that I was the reason all of this happened.
The people know very little about me, they seem to react to my presence which I assume has to do with how weak I currently am.
I am not able to foresee their exact deaths but I can do a little bit to help them.
When the population had dropped down to about 50 I was barely able to keep my self in this realm.
I notice up ahead there was a few trees.
Its been a few years since the bomb that wiped out 99% of the human race went off.
At first I was continuing my job of killing people but I soon came to realize how weak it was making me.
But that isnt the new me, now I have to make sure these people survive.
Without my help the humans were able to get a little bit more population and my energy has slowly returned.
Ive had to make it my new goal to make sure these people survive as long as possible.
She fell face first into the dirt and I felt slightly sorry about causing her pain.
I heard a faint thank you as Lily got up and brushed off her knees.
I counted 4 people working on collecting lumber for new buildings and they were working on a huge oak tree.
My life depends on their population not dying out.
This is how my lifes been these past few years.
The tree fell with a loud crash directly above the spot Lily was going to.
Would I have had her kill herself?I may have even had her get hit by a public bus.
There use to be so many people that I had the privilege of deciding their fate, most people would have been appalled if they had to do what I did.
But now with a little over 200 people left on this planet I must keep them alive.
