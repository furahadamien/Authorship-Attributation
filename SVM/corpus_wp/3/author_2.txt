Add in the fact that no deaths means overpopulation will rise exponentially, draining the worlds resources faster than ever, and soon people will be begging for a death that will never come.
Im taking the formula public.
It will be fun at first, nobody dying, but eventually it will get boring.
I was hard at work in my lab when I heard his voice.
He spun me around to face him.
Think about that when you accept your Nobel, Doctor.
An eternity in Hell, paid on schedule.
Yes, from a major pharmaceutical company.
I knew it was him and I knew what he wanted.
Why not enjoy it?Now if youll excuse me, I have to finish this latest batch to show to the buyers tomorrow.
I had outmaneuvered the Devil himself.
Had I known you would use the funding for this, I-  Would have never made the deal in the first place, blah, blah, blah, I mocked back, cutting him off.
I turned back to my work but stopped when I heard a slow clap building behind me followed by...laughter?Thats all I wanted to hear, he chuckled.
I stood there, stunned, as the weight of his words hit home.
How could I not have seen it?The best part of all, he added, as he took my latest sample and strode towards the door, is you get to hold up your end of the bargain, after all.
With that formula public, immortality will become widespread and rampant.
I never even broke my gaze away from my work.
And who says you cant have it all?
Is that how you see it?Because I see it as stacking the deck.
His eyes were cold, not quite furious but not quite calm, either.
